         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>they doe concerne. This Covenant hath been a port of refuge, to which the Saints have alwayes fled in their di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, they claiming the ble≈ø≈øing therein contained and grounding their hope upon the faithfulnes of him that hath promi≈øed. This Covenant hath been the rock for the anchor of their hope to fa≈øten upon, when the winds &amp; waves of temptation have beaten upon them. The troubles of the Church &amp; people of God are not yet fini≈øhed, by rea≈øon whereof we, no le≈ø≈øe then our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before us, do ≈øtand in need of help and con≈øolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from this Covenant in the≈øe dayes of affliction in which we live. Neither is it only a con≈øolation to know the great things which God hath by Covenant promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed unto us, but it is a foundation to all godline≈ø≈øe and holy walking before God, per≈øwading us to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Lord, as be≈øeems tho≈øe whom he hath taken into Covenant with him, to be a peculiar people to him≈øelf. God hath ≈øo linked together the ble≈ø≈øing of the Covenant (which is his to give) with the dutie and way of it, (which is ours to walk in) that we cannot with comfort expect the one, but it will worke in us a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full endeavour of the other. To ≈øpeake more hereof, I ≈øhall forbeare. When I had fini≈øhed this Treati≈øe, and bethought my ≈øelf to whom I ≈øhould dedicate it, I could not thinke of any, to whom it was ≈øo ≈øuitable as your ≈øelf. You are (to omit other relations) one of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Covenant, which was fir≈øt made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> your Father, and with <hi>Sarah</hi> your Mother, both which, as they lived by faith, ≈øo they dyed in faith, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now received the end of their faith, which they waited for. Your honoured Father, the thoughts of whom are ever precious unto me, was a right <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed; If I ≈øhould ≈øpeake le≈ø≈øe of him, I ≈øhould ≈øpeak too little of that ≈øingular piety, and exemplary grace
<pb facs="tcp:113533:2"/> and godlines which ≈øhined in him. I abhorre giving ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles unto man, but give me leave to beare witnes unto the truth. I knew his faith, his feare, his uprightne≈ø≈øe and holy walking before his God, whereby he became as <hi>a Prince of God</hi> among the people of the world,<note place="margin">Gen. 23.</note> with whom he lived. Wherein he went before you al≈øo, as a patterne to be for ever in your eye, to be imitated by you. Sir, let it (I be≈øeech you) be your chiefe≈øt care, and count it your highe≈øt honour, to walke in the ≈øteps of your pious &amp; ble≈ø≈øed Father. His faith follow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidering what was the end of his conver≈øation. That ≈øweet peace, tho≈øe heavenly con≈øolations, which he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted of, tho≈øe inward feelings which carried him out of him≈øelf, even whiles he was yet in the fle≈øh, are ≈øtrong engagements and encouragements unto you, to walke after his foote, as the Prophets expre≈ø≈øion is, treading in the ≈øame ≈øteps of faith and holines in which he went before you. I am ≈øure you cannot forget tho≈øe dying words of his a little before his end, (You that are in the fle≈øh thinke, &amp;c. I ≈øpare the re≈øt) in mention whereof I ≈øpeak a my≈øtery to others (being but a broken ≈øound) but not to you; you can interpret my meaning and 'tis enough to me that you know the meaning of them, for who≈øe ≈øake I mention them, that you may often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them for your own good. They will never out of my heart, and I tru≈øt they will never be forgotten by you. Goe on (deare Sir,) in the wayes of grace which you are entred into, the Lord having made good his Covenant towards you, be you al≈øo mindfull to walke in Covenant with your God. Set Gods kindne≈ø≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, to ≈øtir up your ≈øelf the more to walke before him in his truth. The more you honour him, the more you honour your ≈øelf. Study therefore to do great things for God; ≈øeeke the peace of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:113533:3"/> pro≈øperitie of <hi>Sion.</hi> Your goodnes extendeth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but to his Church and Saints that are here on earth; yet what you doe unto them, he will ≈øay, <hi>Yee have done it unto mee.</hi> Remember <hi>Davids</hi> troubles, <hi>Jo≈øephs</hi> affliction, <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds, the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed e≈øtate of Gods Church and people, and thinke of <hi>Mordecai</hi> his <hi>Item</hi> to <hi>E≈øther.</hi> This way was <hi>Davids</hi> ≈øpirit working when he was ≈øitting in peace in his own hou≈øe; He was con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what the LORD had done for him, and what he ≈øhould render to the Lord for all his benefits. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull was his zeale for the Hou≈øe of God; The co≈øt he prepared for it was almo≈øt incredible, an hundred thou≈øand talents of gold, be≈øides ≈øilver &amp; other things without number; but he lo≈øt nothing by all, (no man lo≈øeth by lending to the Lord, no more then the rivers doe by powring their water into the Sea, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive back againe by ≈øecret pa≈ø≈øages in the earth, and ≈øo are ≈øtill ever full.) The more he honoured God, the more God honoured him. He ≈øpared not his riches in things pertaining to God, and God ca≈øt in more upon him ≈øtill, ≈øo that he dyed in riches and honour, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.28. Let your life be like his, and then in death you ≈øhall not be divided. The God of all grace, who hath done ≈øo great things for you, go on in ble≈ø≈øing to ble≈ø≈øe you, that you may with <hi>Nephthali</hi> be ≈øatisfied with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and filled with the ble≈ø≈øing of the Lord, even with all ble≈ø≈øings of heaven and earth, of this life, and of that to come.</p>

It is now ≈øome five or ≈øix yeares ≈øince I fir≈øt began to handle this doctrine now publi≈øhed, a time then full of trouble in the≈øe American Churches, through the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate activene≈øs, and impetuous violence of ≈øome bu≈øie ≈øpirits (of whom the Country is now well rid through the Lords great goodnes) deeming all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (except them≈øelves) to be wholly ignorant of the Covenant of grace, and to be ≈øhut up under a Covenant of workes; All the Preachers in the Land were legall Preachers, the Chri≈øtians, legall Chri≈øtians, as having onely the letter of the Go≈øpel, but not under≈øtanding the my≈øtery or ≈øpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meaning of it, as it was revealed unto them≈øelves by the ≈øpirit. The di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the two Covenants did then exceedingly trouble the minds of many, amongst whom there was little ≈øpeech but about the covenant of grace and of workes, and of being under a Covenant of workes. I having then in the cour≈øe of my Mini≈øtery propounded to my ≈øelf this order to follow, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on one part of the Lords day to handle one part of the body of Divinitie, concerning God, Creation, Man, his fir≈øt pure e≈øtate, and ≈øo on, concluding that part with his lap≈øed and falne e≈øtate; and on the other part of the day to ≈øpeak of the means of Gods re≈øtoring man againe to the ≈øtate of ≈øalvation; I could not then pa≈ø≈øe by the handling of the Covenant of grace, without a purpo≈øed declining from that, which both the agitations of the Countrey, and mine own propo≈øed method did lead me unto. Hereupon I entred upon the handling of this ≈øubject in the ordinary cour≈øe of my Mini≈øtry, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring my ≈øelf (≈øo far as the Lord enabled me) to ≈øettle the minds of tho≈øe amongst whom I lived, in the knowledge of the truth, concerning which ≈øome were wavering, by rea≈øon of tho≈øe ≈øpirits of error which were gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, deceiving the minds of ≈øome. This was the occa≈øion of handling this doctrine. When I had fini≈øhed it, it plea≈øed God to give it ≈øuch acceptance in the hearts of the hearers, that many of the chiefe amongst them came to me with a ≈øolemn reque≈øt, de≈øiring me to publi≈øh what I had delivered, that ≈øo they might have it continue with them, which reque≈øt of theirs, as it was unexpected by me, ≈øo was I both unwilling, and unable to ≈øatisfie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire; unwilling, as being con≈øcious to my ≈øelf of mine own infirmities, unfit to publi≈øh any thing in this learned age; and unable, as not having ≈øo pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any part of it, as to make it fit for publick u≈øe. But the earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe of their de≈øire on the one ≈øide, and the rawne≈ø≈øe of the draught which I had written for the help of my ≈øelf, on the other ≈øide, ≈øo far cro≈ø≈øing one another, gave occa≈øion of a ≈øecond revi≈øing of what was before done; which al≈øo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed
<pb facs="tcp:113533:4"/> ≈øome further additions thereunto, and hath at la≈øt brought forth that (≈øuch as it is) which is now pre≈øented to thy view. And thus thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtande≈øt (gentle Reader) the occa≈øion both of the preaching and publi≈øhing of the doctrine of the Covenant which now comes forth. Which (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the former inducements) I ≈øhould hardly have adventured to have publi≈øhed, had I not been encouraged thereto by ≈øome others of better note. It is not any confidence I have in my ≈øelf which hath drawne me forth into publick view. I thank God, I do in ≈øome mea≈øure know mine own weaknes. But if the Lord will u≈øe his weake≈øt in≈øtruments to perfect his own prai≈øe, who am I that I ≈øhould let God? I wi≈øh this had been undertaken by ≈øome other of greater ≈øtrength, but none hitherto appearing in this kinde, being de≈øired to what I have done, I have been content to yeeld to the de≈øires of tho≈øe that have per≈øwaded me hereunto. There is a Treati≈øe of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> publi≈øhed ≈øome yeares ago by a precious light in the Church of God, who≈øe worke is come almo≈øt into all mens hands. If that worthy ≈øervant of Chri≈øt, had lived to ≈øee the≈øe dayes we now live in, or then were, when the≈øe things were delivered, I doubt not but he would with much more accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe have handled the≈øe things then my weakne≈ø≈øe is able to attaine unto. But God having carried him to his re≈øting place, before the≈øe que≈øtions brake forth, which have ≈øince troubled, and doe ≈øtill trouble the world, it is not to be marvelled that ≈øome one coming after him, inferior unto him, may adde ≈øomething to that which hath been before delivered. The opinions formerly ≈øtirring in <hi>New-England,</hi> and now in old, (if fame be not a lyer) have given occa≈øion to touch ≈øome things not of ordinary occurrence. As namely, <hi>1.</hi> Whether the Covenant of grace be made betwixt God and man, or onely betwixt God the Father and Chri≈øt. <hi>2.</hi> Where al≈øo (by occa≈øion of the former que≈øtion) is handled that place in <hi>Gal. 3.16.</hi> concerning the one ≈øeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which the promi≈øes are made, which ≈øeede is Chri≈øt, ≈øhewing who is that one ≈øeed there called Chri≈øt. <hi>3.</hi> What the Covenant at <hi>Sinai</hi> was, whether a Covenant of workes, or of grace. <hi>4.</hi> Whether ju≈øtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be evidenced by ≈øanctification, &amp; whether that way of evidencing be a going a≈øide to a Covenant of workes; and whether one under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works may be truly ≈øanctified. <hi>5.</hi> Whether the commandement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding faith, be a commandement of the Law, or no. <hi>6.</hi> Whether faith be a condition onely con≈øequent to our ju≈øtification, &amp; not antecedent. <hi>7.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conditionall promi≈øes be promi≈øes of free grace or no, and of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with tho≈øe promi≈øes which are called <hi>ab≈øolute.</hi> The≈øe and ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øuch pa≈ø≈øages are herein touched, as occa≈øion was mini≈øtred by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter handled. And in regard that ≈øome of the ≈øame opinions are now ≈øtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:113533:5"/> in old <hi>England,</hi> which lately troubled New, my hope in the Lord is, that this my weak endeavour (the Lord accompanying it with his ble≈ø≈øing) may be of ≈øome u≈øe now in the≈øe times; if not to recall tho≈øe that are led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide by errour, yet to ≈øettle ≈øome that are doubtfull and wavering in the truth. But though the≈øe things are touched here and there, yet my chiefe ayme hath been to lead on the weake Chri≈øtian to a practicall u≈øe of the truths which are here delivered; in which the greate≈øt part of this work is ≈øpent. If in any of the≈øe, thou finde≈øt thy ≈øelf helped by this my labour, either in thy knowledge or practi≈øe, returne glory to God, and help me by thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that I may ≈øo fini≈øh that little remnant of my cour≈øe which is yet before me, that I may rejoyce in the day of Chri≈øt, that I have not run in vaine, neither have laboured in vaine. If any that are more judicious ≈øhall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øafe to ≈øee what is herein performed, and ≈øhall thinke them≈øelves burdened with interruption by rea≈øon of application by u≈øe of each point delivered; I de≈øire them to con≈øider, that as in the preaching, ≈øo in the publi≈øhing of this Treati≈øe, it was then, &amp; is now, intended rather for their ≈øakes which ≈øtand in need of both, then for ≈øuch as need not. I write not to teach the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, but to help the weak, who ≈øtand in need not only to know the truth, but to be led on, to ≈øee how the knowledge of it doth ≈øerve to any u≈øe for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øe of life. One thing more I may not omit; Whereas it may be marvailed, that in the beginning of the Treati≈øe I propound two points to be handled, <hi>viz.</hi> fir≈øt, to ≈øhew the nature of the Covenant of grace, and ≈øecondly, that we are ≈øaved by that Covenant, and not by the Covenant of workes, whereas I ≈øay, both the≈øe are propounded, and yet I handle but one of them, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of my ≈øo doing is, partly becau≈øe I ≈øaw the Treati≈øe to exceed in bulk what I expected in the beginning, partly becau≈øe the handling of the former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth an≈øwer the end, which in the beginning was aymed at, which was to open the nature and ≈øub≈øtance of the Covenant of grace, and partly al≈øo becau≈øe this is my fir≈øt adventure in this kinde. If this which I have done ≈øhall finde acceptance with the Saints, I may adde the re≈øt in due time, if the Lord give life and ≈øtrength; otherwi≈øe I ≈øhall thinke this enough and too much, which is done already. In the meane time I commend this my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, with thee (courteous Reader) to the ble≈ø≈øing of God, be≈øeeching him that is the God of all grace, to enable us ≈øo to live a life of grace here, that in the end we may enjoy the grace of life, according to the covenant and promi≈øe of grace <hi>w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ble≈ø≈øed God hath evermore delighted to reveale and communicate him≈øelfe by way of Covenant; he might have done good to man before his fall; as al≈øo ≈øince his fall, without binding him≈øelfe in the bond of Covenant. <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Jewes, Gentiles might have had the ble≈ø≈øings intended, without any promi≈øe or Covenant, but the Lords heart is ≈øo full of love (e≈øpecially to his owne) that it cannot be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ≈øo long within the bounds of ≈øecrecie, <hi>viz.</hi> from Gods eternall purpo≈øe to the actuall accompli≈øhment of good things intended, but it mu≈øt aforehand overflow and breake out into the many ≈øtreames of a ble≈ø≈øed Covenant, the Lord can never get neer enough to his people, and thinkes he can never get them neer enough unto him≈øelfe, and therefore unites and binds and fa≈øtens them clo≈øe to him≈øelfe, and him≈øelfe unto them by the bonds of a Covenant. And therefore when wee breake our Covenant, and that will not hold us, he takes a fa≈øter bond, and makes a ≈øure and everla≈øting Covenant; according to grace, not according to workes, and that ≈øhall hold his people firme unto him≈øelfe, and hold him≈øelfe clo≈øe and fa≈øt unto them, that he may never depart from us. Oh the depth of Gods grace herein, that when ≈øinfull man de≈øerves never to have the lea≈øt good word from him, that he ≈øhould open his whole heart and purpo≈øe to him, in a Covenant; that when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerves nothing el≈øe but ≈øeparation from God, and to be driven up and downe the world, as a vagabond, or as dryed leaves, fallen from our God, that yet the Almighty God cannot be content with it, but mu≈øt make him≈øelfe to us, and us to him≈øelfe more ≈øure and neare then ever before! And is not this Covenant then (Chri≈øtian Reader) worth thy looking into and ≈øearching after? Surely never was there a time wherein the Lord calls his people to more ≈øerious ≈øearching into the nature of the Covenant, then in the≈øe dayes. For are there not ≈øome who cut off the entaile to children of tho≈øe in
<pb facs="tcp:113533:6"/> Covenant, and ≈øo le≈ø≈øen &amp; ≈øhorten the riches of grace in the Lords free Covenant, and that in the time of more grace under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel, then he was wont to di≈øpen≈øe under the Law? Are there not others who preach a new or rather another Go≈øpel or Covenant, <hi>viz</hi> That actuall remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, and reconciliation with God (purcha≈øed indeed in Redemption by Chri≈øts death) is without, nay, before faith; the Condition (though wrought of God) of the Covenant of grace, expre≈øly oppo≈øed to the Law or Covenant of workes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. and ever required as the meanes (and therefore antecedent) to the attainment of tho≈øe ends in the con≈øtant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtry of the Apo≈øtles of Chri≈øt, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.43? Is it not time for the people of God now to pry into the ≈øecret of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (which he reveales to them that feare him, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 25.14.) when by clipping of it, and di≈øtingui≈øhing about it, the beautifull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of it begins to be changed and transformed by tho≈øe Angels of new light which once it had, when it began to be publi≈øhed in the ≈øimplicity of it by the Apo≈øtles of Chri≈øt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. Nay, is not the time come, wherein the Lord of ho≈øts ≈øeemes to have a quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all the world, and e≈øpecially his Churches and people, whom he goes on to wa≈øte by the ≈øharpe≈øt ≈øword that (almo≈øt) was ever drawne out? and is it not the dutie of all that have but the lea≈øt ≈øparke of holy feare and trembling, to aske and ≈øearch diligently, what ≈øhould be the rea≈øon of this ≈øore anger and hot di≈øplea≈øure, before they and theirs be con≈øumed in the burning flames of it? Search the Scriptures, and there we ≈øhall find the cau≈øe, and ≈øee God him≈øelf laying his finger upon that which is the ≈øore, &amp; the wound of ≈øuch times; for ≈øo it is ≈øaid, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 24.1. to 5. <hi>Behold, the Lord maketh the earth emptie and wa≈øte, and turnes it up≈øide downe, and ≈øcattereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the inhabitants thereof; and it ≈øhall be as with the people, ≈øo with the Prie≈øt; and the Land ≈øhall be utterly ≈øpoyled.</hi> Why? <hi>For the earth is defiled under the Inhabitants thereof;</hi> Why ≈øo? <hi>Becau≈øe they have tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øed the Lawes, changed the Ordinance, and broken the Everla≈øting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi> and therefore when the Lord ≈øhall have wa≈øted his Church, and hath made it as <hi>Adnah</hi> and <hi>Leboim,</hi> when heathen Nations ≈øhall aske, Wherefore hath the Lord done all this again≈øt this Land? what meaneth the heat of his great anger? The an≈øwer is made by the Lord him≈øelfe expre≈øly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.25. viz. <hi>Becau≈øe they have for≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the</hi> Covenant <hi>of the Lord God of their fathers, &amp;c.</hi> And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for they that reject the Covenant of grace, they breake the
<pb facs="tcp:113533:6"/> league of peace between God and them≈øelves; and hence if acts of ho≈øtilitie in de≈øolating Kingdomes, Churches, families, and per≈øons, break out from a long ≈øuffering God, they may ea≈øily ≈øee the cau≈øe; and that the cau≈øe and quarrell of God herein is ju≈øt. As all good things are conveyed to Gods people, not barely by common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but by ≈øpeciall Covenant, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 63.8, 9. So all the evills they meet with in this world (if in them the face of Gods anger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares) upon narrow ≈øearch will be found to ari≈øe from breach of Covenant more or le≈ø≈øe. So that if it be the great Cau≈øe of all the publick calamities of the Church and people of God, and tho≈øe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities are already begun, and Gods hand is ≈øtretched out ≈øtill; Was there then ever a more ≈øea≈øonable time and houre to ≈øtudy the Covenant, and ≈øo ≈øee the ≈øin, repent of it, and at la≈øt to lay hold of Gods rich grace and bowels in it, le≈øt the Lord goe on and fulfill the word of his ≈øervants, &amp; expo≈øe mo≈øt plea≈øant lands to the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamentation of a very little remnant, re≈øerved as a few coales in the a≈øhes, when all el≈øe is con≈øumed. As particular per≈øons when they breake their Covenant, the Lord therefore breaks out again≈øt them; So when whole Churches for≈øake their Covenant, the Lord therefore doth ≈øorely vi≈øit them. Sins of ignorance the Lord Je≈øus pities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. and many times winkes at; but ≈øins again≈øt light he cannot endure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Sins again≈øt light are great, but ≈øins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt purpo≈øe and Covenant, nay Gods Covenant, are by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees wor≈øe; for the ≈øoule of man ru≈øheth mo≈øt violently and ≈øtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again≈øt God, when it breakes through all the light of the mind, and purpo≈øes of the will, that ≈øtand in his way to keep him from ≈øin; and is not this done by breach of Covenant? And therefore no wonder if the Lord makes his peoples chaine heavy by ≈øore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, untill they come to con≈øider &amp; behold this ≈øin, and learne more feare (after they are bound to their good behaviour,) of breaking Covenant with God againe. It is true, the Covenant effectually made, can never be really broke, yet externally it may; But ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe Gods Churches were in greate≈øt peace, and had a ble≈ø≈øed re≈øt from all their labours round about them; yet what is the childes portion, but his legacy left him written with the finger of God his Father, in the new Covenant, and the bloud of Je≈øus Chri≈øt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, in his la≈øt Will and Te≈øtament? What is a Chri≈øtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and where doth it chiefly lie, but in this, That the Lord hath made with him an everla≈øting Covenant, in all things ≈øtabli≈øhed and
<pb facs="tcp:113533:7"/> ≈øure? Which were the la≈øt breathings of the ≈øweet Singer of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and the la≈øt bublings up of the joy of his heart, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. God the Fathers eternall purpo≈øes are ≈øealed ≈øecrets, not immediately ≈øeene, and the full and ble≈ø≈øed accompli≈øhments of tho≈øe purpo≈øes are not yet experimentally felt; the Covenant is the mid≈øt between both Gods purpo≈øes and performances, by which and in which we come to ≈øee the one, before the world began, and by a ble≈ø≈øed Faith (which makes things ab≈øent, pre≈øent) to enjoy the other, which ≈øhall be our glory, when this world ≈øhall be burnt up, and all things in it ≈øhall have an end. For in Gods Covenant and promi≈øe we ≈øee with open face Gods ≈øecret purpo≈øe for time pa≈øt. Gods purpo≈øes toward his people being as it were nothing el≈øe but promi≈øes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and Gods promi≈øes in the Covenant being nothing el≈øe but his purpo≈øes revealed; as al≈øo in the ≈øame Covenant and promi≈øes we ≈øee performances for future, as if they were accompli≈øhments at pre≈øent. Where then is a Chri≈øtians comfort, but in that Covenant wherein two Eternities (as it were) meet together, &amp; whereby he may ≈øee acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pli≈øhments (made ≈øure to him) of eternall glory, ari≈øing from ble≈ø≈øed purpo≈øes of eternall Grace? In a word, wherein he fa≈øtens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and hath him from everla≈øting to everla≈øting, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at hand neare and obvious in his words of a gracious Covenant?</p>
            <p>The Church of God is therefore bound to ble≈ø≈øe God much for this food in ≈øea≈øon, and for the holy judicious and learned labours of this aged, experienced, and precious ≈øervant of Chri≈øt Je≈øus; who hath taken much paines to di≈øcover, and that not in words and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, but in the demon≈øtration and evidence of the Spirit, the great my≈øtery of godlines wrapt up in the Covenant; and hath now fully opened ≈øundry knotty que≈øtions concerning the ≈øame, which happily have not been brought ≈øo fully to light untill now; which cannot but be of ≈øingular and ≈øea≈øonable u≈øe, to prevent Apo≈øta≈øies from the ≈øimplicity of the Covenant and Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were preached in the remote ends of the earth, and as it were ≈øet under a Bu≈øhell, a Church more remote from the numerous ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of others of the Saints: if now therefore the light be ≈øet upon a hill, 'tis where it ≈øhould ≈øtand, &amp; where Chri≈øt ≈øurely would have it put. The good Lord enlighten the minds of all tho≈øe who ≈øeek for the truth by this &amp; ≈øuch like helps; and the Lord enlighten the whole world with his glory, even with the glory of his Covenant, grace &amp; love, that his people hereby may be ≈øealed up daily unto all fulne≈ø≈øe of a≈ø≈øurance and peace, in the≈øe evill times.</p>

A ≈øecond promi≈øe, is that he would be a protection unto them; <hi>I will be a wall of fire about you,</hi> ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. A wall of ≈øafe defence to you, and fire to burne up your enemies, if any invade you.

Fourthly, He promi≈øes his pre≈øence among them, which is the felicitie of any people; <hi>I will dwell in the midde≈øt of thee,</hi> ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. By the≈øe manifold promi≈øes, the Lord doth by his Prophet per≈øwade the people to returne. A ≈øtrange thing that being captives, they mu≈øt have ≈øo many motives to returne to the Land of their freedome and libertie.</p>
               <p>Now this Captivitie of the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as it was <hi>res ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øta,</hi> a thing reall and done, an affliction brought upon them for their ≈øinning again≈øt the Lord: So I finde it in Scripture applyed to three things, as a re≈øemblance and type thereof. Fir≈øt, It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the naturall e≈øtate of all men, who were at fir≈øt created free, being ≈øubject to none, but onely to him who is Lord over all, but are now by ≈øin like the <hi>Jewes</hi> in an e≈øtate of bondage. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication I finde made by the Apo≈øtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Come out from among them, touch no uncleane thing.</hi> Which words were fir≈øt ≈øpoken to and of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in <hi>E≈øay</hi> 52. <hi>ver.</hi> 4.11. calling them out of their Captivitie. But the Apo≈øtle applyes them to all, whether <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their naturall uncleanne≈ø≈øe, calling upon them to come out of the ≈øinfull pollution of the world. Secondly, It is applyed to the ≈øtate of the Church under the tyranny of Antichri≈øt; for as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113533:9"/> that Ea≈øterne <hi>Babel</hi> did afflict and oppre≈ø≈øe the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which were then the Church of God; ≈øo <hi>Rome</hi> the We≈øterne <hi>Babel</hi> doth keepe under the Church of God now, and long time hath done, and therefore the people of God are called to come out of her,<note place="margin">Apoc. 18.2.4.</note> as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were called to come forth from the Ea≈øterne <hi>Babel,</hi> Jer. 51.6.8.<note place="margin">Jer. 51.6.8.</note>

Thirdly, It is applyed to the pre≈øent mi≈øerable for≈øaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in which they now lie, they being now a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe people, ca≈øt off by God, for their ca≈øting off of Chri≈øt.<note place="margin">Joh. 1.11.</note>

This e≈øtate of theirs, <hi>E≈øay</hi> ≈øets forth in words not much differing from my text; <hi>This people</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>is robbed and ≈øpoyled, and ≈øhall be ≈ønared in dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons; they ≈øhall be hid in pri≈øon-hou≈øes; they ≈øhall be for a prey, and none ≈øhall deliver, for a ≈øpoyle, and none ≈øhall ≈øay, re≈øtore.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">E≈øa. 42.21.</note> And this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent bondage is typed out by their captivitie in <hi>Babylon;</hi> as we may ≈øee by comparing <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. with <hi>E≈øay</hi> 59.20. That which was in the letter of it, ≈øpoken of their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from under the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the ≈øame doth the Apo≈øtle apply to their la≈øt deliverance, which is yet to come. <hi>The redeemer ≈øhall come to Sion, and turne ungodline≈ø≈øe from Jacob.</hi> As their captivitie in <hi>Babel,</hi> re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their pre≈øent captive condition now, ≈øo their deliverance out of <hi>Babel</hi> then, typed out their deliverance which ≈øhal come unto them out of their pre≈øent mi≈øery, when <hi>the Redeemer ≈øhall againe come unto Sion, and turne away ungodline≈ø≈øe from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now of this deliverance out of their pre≈øent captivitie; I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand this Text, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.11. <hi>As for thee al≈øo, by the blond of thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, I have ≈øent out thy pri≈øoners out of the pit, &amp;c.</hi> By vertue of the Covenant made with their fathers, they ≈øhall be delivered out of the bondage in which they are now holden.</p>
               <p>To apply it to the≈øe times, is contrary to the words of the Text,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> for the Text ≈øpeakes of a thing pa≈øt, <hi>I</hi> have <hi>≈øent forth, &amp;c.</hi> therefore not of things to come.</p>

               <p>If it be ≈øaid, that their mourning for him whom they pierced, was fulfilled in the repentance of tho≈øe <hi>Jewes</hi> mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. ≈øo as there is no further accompli≈øhment thereof to be looked for.</p>
               <p>I an≈øwer; This that is alledged cannot ≈øtand with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances expre≈ø≈øed in the Text; for that mourning ≈øpoken of, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. is of ≈øuch a time in which God will be with <hi>Judah,</hi> and with the people of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> in a ≈øpeciall manner, in the ≈øiege which ≈øhall be again≈øt <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> at which time, God will make <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øalem,</hi> as an heavie ≈øtone to breake in pieces all the people of the earth that lift at it, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3.

What was ≈øpoken of them, is appliable to all that are in the ≈øame e≈øtate with them; There is by nature but one e≈øtate of all men, whether Jewes or Gentiles, whether we ≈øpeake of ≈øin or mi≈øery; thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is that what <hi>E≈øay</hi> before ≈øpake of the di≈øpo≈øition and ≈øinne of the Jewes, in <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 59.7, 8. the ≈øame doth the Apo≈øtle apply gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unto all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. As ≈øhewing thereby what is ≈øpoken of the ≈øin of one people, may be ≈øpoken of all, which are in the ≈øame naturall e≈øtate with them; there may be ≈øeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees both of ≈øin and mi≈øery in ≈øeverall people, but the e≈øtate is the ≈øame in all. It was noted before, how the e≈øtate of the Jewes in their Babyloni≈øh captivitie, was applied to three other things, as types of them.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, to the naturall e≈øtate of all men, who are in ≈øpirituall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as they were in outward:</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:113533:19"/>
               <p>Secondly, to the captivity of the Church under <hi>Antichri≈øt:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to the ≈øervile condition which the <hi>Jews</hi> are in.</p>
               <p>Now, the≈øe three are not things ≈øo different in nature, that they cannot ≈øometimes meet all together in one, they being but as ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øeverall degrees of one and the ≈øame naturall e≈øtate.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, ≈øome are meerly naturall, and no more, as not having gone ≈øo far, as to defile them≈øelves with the abominations of the Whore of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, others have proceeded further, and dallied with that Strumpet, and gone in unto her, and have drunk of the wine of her fornication.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, others have gone further then both the former, even to the execrable malice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ≈øo as to hate and maligne the ways of Chri≈øt, as the <hi>Jews</hi> do accur≈øe his name at this day. Now, whether we con≈øider one or other of the≈øe, they are all but ≈øo many ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees of the ≈øame e≈øtate of nature. And ≈øo there being but one e≈øtate of all men, therefore, what is truly ≈øaid of one, may be truly ≈øaid of all, only re≈øerving to each of them that particular degree of ≈øin or mi≈øery, which is proper to them, but the ≈øame e≈øtate is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all. So that the <hi>Jews</hi> being for their ≈øin ca≈øt off, and become pri≈øonees in the pit, this their e≈øtate may fitly be applied to all men that are in the ≈øame naturall e≈øtate, excepting only the particular degree, as is before expre≈ø≈øed; their heighth and excellency belong to them alone, and yet the ≈øame promi≈øes, in the ≈øub≈øtance of them, do belong unto all the faithfull: ≈øo it is concerning their ≈øin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery which lies upon them; a particular degree thereof may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto them, but the ≈øame e≈øtate is common to all. So then, draw we unto our ≈øelves that which is here ≈øpoken of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then the ≈øumme of this Text is this, that even as they, ≈øo we, are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the pri≈øon pit, till we be brought forth by the blood of the Covenant applied unto us. Let me explain the words a little, and ≈øo make way for the Ob≈øervations:</p>
               <p>What is meant by the <hi>Pit</hi> here ≈øpoken of?</p>
               <p>So far as concernes the <hi>Jews,</hi> it notes out the pre≈øent outward thraldome in which they are holden under the nations among which they live; as al≈øo that ≈øpirituall captivity in which they lie, being ≈øhut up under ≈øin and unbeliefe, as it is expre≈ø≈øed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. And in this latter re≈øpect, it is common to us with them; we being
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113533:20"/> all of us captives under the dominion of our ≈øpirituall enemies, as well as they.</p>
               <p>What is the water here ≈øpoken of? the pit wherein there is no water? the idle toyes, and Frier-like conceits about Purgatory drawn from hence, I pa≈ø≈øe by, as not worthy ≈øpending time about them. Waters in Scripture, ≈øignifie two things; ≈øometimes they ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie affliction, ≈øorrow, danger, trouble, and perplexity, as we may ≈øee in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 18.16. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 32.6. and 69 1, 2. Sometimes again they are taken in a quite contrary ≈øen≈øe, ≈øignifying joy, comfort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre≈øhing, as in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 23.2. <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. where the Lord compares him ≈øelf to a Fountain of living waters, which gives plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous refre≈øhing and con≈øolation. In this latter ≈øen≈øe it is taken here in this Text, for joy or comfort; ≈øo that the meaning is, that as the <hi>Jews,</hi> ≈øo we, one and other of us, we are ≈øhut up as pri≈øoners in the dungeon and pit of the pri≈øon, where there is no water of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to refre≈øh our ≈øouls withall, we may finde dirt and mire there, in which we may ≈øtick fa≈øt, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did, in his pri≈øon, but there is no water of comfort to be found there. The loo≈øing, or ≈øending forth of the pit, is the deliverance and freedome, which comes by the blood of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, called here, The blood of the Covenant: Fir≈øt, becau≈øe it ratifieth the Covenant betwixt God and us, as we ≈øhall ≈øee afterwards. Secondly, becau≈øe the Covenant directs us to the blood of Chri≈øt to ≈øeek our freedome from it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having the ≈øen≈øe, we may in the words con≈øider the≈øe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The naturall e≈øtate of men, ≈øet forth in two degrees:
<list>
                     <item>1. We are pri≈øoners in the pit, captives.</item>
                     <item>2. De≈øtitute of all comfort, being in a pit wherein is no water.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The promi≈øe of deliverance, <hi>I have loo≈øed,</hi> that is, <hi>will loo≈øe; I will grant a deliverance;</hi> and this is ≈øet forth,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, by the moving cau≈øe, namely, Gods free grace, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed, but implyed in this, when it's ≈øaid, <hi>By thy covenant I will ≈øend forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> by that free goodne≈ø≈øe and grace of mine, by which I fir≈øt entred into a covenant with thee, and for thee, will I ≈øend thee deliverance out of this mi≈øery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the meriting cau≈øe of it, <hi>The blood of the covenant,</hi> the blood of Chri≈øt; for though the deliverance be free to us, by free grace in re≈øpect of any thing done by us; yet it is obtained for us by the blood of Chri≈øt.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:113533:20"/>
               <p>From all together, ob≈øerve the≈øe four things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are all naturally in a ≈øtate of bondage, as pri≈øoners in the pit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ≈øo long as we continue in this e≈øtate, nothing that we do enjoy, can give us any ≈øound comfort; there is no water in the pit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That though our condition be thus mi≈øerable and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe, yet there is both freedome from this bondage, and comfort to be obtained by the blood of the covenant; in Chri≈øt there is both an opening of the pri≈øon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>o tho≈øe that are bound, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of living water, to refre≈øh the thir≈øty ≈øouls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That what≈øoever ≈øalvation and deliverance God gives unto his people, in ≈øetting them free from this mi≈øery, he doth it by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of, and according to his covenant. The≈øe are the ≈øumme of all.</p>
               <p>The≈øe four points the Text offers to our con≈øideration, all which, though handled publikely, and intended to have been publi≈øhed with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>hich now comes forth; yet finding the Treati≈øe to grow bigger then I thought in the beginning, I have now upon ≈øecond con≈øideration, re≈øolved to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe the three fir≈øt ob≈øervations, and to in≈øi≈øt only upon the fourth, as being that which is mo≈øt pertinent to the pre≈øent ≈øcope intended. The thing then which here we have now to con≈øider, is this, <hi>≈øc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all the deliverances and ≈øalvation, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>4</label> which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to his people, he doth it by vertue of, and according to his Covenant. So in the Text, <hi>by the blood of thy Covenant I have,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not ≈øay by blood ≈øimply, but <hi>by the bood of the Covenant,</hi> becau≈øe the blood goes with the Covenant betwixt God and us. Hence it is, that we reade in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. when <hi>David</hi> looked at the <hi>Covenant</hi> which God had made with him, he makes <hi>that</hi> the ground and foundation of all the mercy and deliverance which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: Herein (≈øaith he) is all my ≈øalvation, that <hi>God hath made with me a ≈øure Covenant.</hi> Con≈øider the truth of this point, both in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary deliverance, and ≈øpirituall ≈øalvations, (as the Text points at both, as we ≈øhewed before:) Fir≈øt, concerning temporall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, ≈øee what God ≈øaith unto <hi>Noah,</hi> concerning his deliverance from the flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.18. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.1. <hi>With thee will I e≈øtabli≈øh my Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. and then God remembers <hi>Noah,</hi> and all that was with him in the Ark, and brought them to dry land again; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113533:21"/> was given him by covenant: See al≈øo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. God promi≈øes to bring his people from under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, and why ≈øo? becau≈øe he remembred his Covenant with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: in <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.25.44, 45. The Lord tells them, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 25. that if they ≈øinned again≈øt him, he would avenge upon them the quarrell of his Covenant, but yet in <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 44, 45. if they returned to him, he would remember <hi>the Covenant</hi> which he had made with them, and deliver them out of their captivity. Secondly, all ≈øpirituall ≈øalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is communicated by Gods Covenant, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 111.9. he ≈øent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to his people, becau≈øe he was ever mindfull of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he <hi>commanded</hi> his Covenant for ever, as the word is there, <hi>i. e.</hi> he commanded it to ≈øtand fa≈øt for ever: So in <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.17, 18. he will return and have compa≈ø≈øion upon us, and forgive our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, what is the foundation of this? he will remember his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which he hath made with us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. that he might ≈øhew him≈øelf mindfull of his holy Covenant, therefore he ≈øent the Lord Je≈øus to perform the work of redemption for his people: as in the beginning, when God fir≈øt promi≈øed life to <hi>Adam,</hi> it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a covenant made with him, (though not the ≈øame that we mu≈øt look for life by, (as we ≈øhall ≈øee more afterwards,) yet God made a covenant with him <hi>(Do this and live;)</hi> ≈øo it is now with us, it is by vertue of the Covenant, that we mu≈øt expect life and ≈øalvation from Gods hand, the beginning of our ≈øalvation (which is begun in the fir≈øt grace given to us in our conver≈øion, and turning unto God) is given unto us according to the covenant begun with us in Chri≈øt, and the end of our ≈øalvation is according to the covenant which he makes with our ≈øelves, in our own per≈øons.</p>
               <p>The grounds and rea≈øons why the Lord taketh this cour≈øe to convey life and ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe to us by covenant, are the≈øe:</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rea≈øon </seg>1</label> God doth herein wonderfully glorifie him≈øelf in the manife≈øtation of his faithfulne≈ø≈øe and truth, in keeping covenant with his people; God ≈øaith in Scripture ≈øometimes he will do this, or that, and you <hi>≈øhall know</hi> that I am the Lord, <hi>Gods glory is in being known,</hi> Rom. 2.5. and 9.22.

And the Apo≈øtle al≈øo, when he ≈øpeaks of Chri≈øts coming in the fle≈øh, attributes it to Gods truth and faithfulne≈ø≈øe, in keeping covenant with their fathers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8, 9. It was <hi>mercy to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> (as he ≈øaith, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might glorifie God <hi>for his mercy</hi>) but it was <hi>truth and faithfulne≈ø≈øe to the</hi> Jews; if he had never entred into covenant with us, he might have manife≈øted mercy unto us, but he could never have made known his faitfulne≈ø≈øe.</p>

Hence it is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1. and <hi>ver.</hi> 12.16. he is called <hi>Abraham our father, the father of many Nations, the father of us all,</hi> namely, of all that doe believe.

               <p>As it is thus in the type, ≈øo in the antitype, Gods covenant is not made with tho≈øe that are as <hi>I≈øhmael,</hi> which are borne after the fle≈øh, and ≈øeek for life by the works of the Law; but with tho≈øe that are as <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> the children of the promi≈øe, and ≈øeeke for ≈øalvation by faith in Chri≈øt, tho≈øe onely are counted for the true ≈øeed. And thus it is but one ≈øeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> which the promi≈øe is made unto.</p>

               <p>To this the Apo≈øtle an≈øwers, No; and gives a double rea≈øon of his deniall; Fir≈øt, That the Covenant or Te≈øtament of God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, no man may adde or alter any thing therein, therefore much more is Gods Covenant unalterable, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Covenant was confirmed before in re≈øpect of Chri≈øt, or with re≈øpect to Chri≈øt, and onely to that ≈øeed which is by faith

And hereto agrees that which follows, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 17. that the covenant was confirmed before with re≈øpect to Chri≈øt, Chri≈øt is the bond of the covenant betwixt God and us, ≈øo as if that covenant which God hath made with re≈øpect unto Chri≈øt, ≈øhould be broken and di≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, it could not but be a neglect ca≈øt upon Chri≈øt him≈øelf; but this cannot be, therefore the covenant made with re≈øpect unto Chri≈øt, and made with that ≈øeed which is Chri≈øts, and one with him, mu≈øt needs ≈øtand fa≈øt, and never be di≈øanulled.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ≈øee, how the taking of (Chri≈øt) for Chri≈øt my≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, agreeth both with o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And when they ≈øay it is to one ≈øeed, therefore not to us, being many. I an≈øwer, it followes not, if by many, they under≈øtand many per≈øons, the per≈øons of all the faithfull making up but one ≈øpirituall ≈øeed, as the whole number of tho≈øe that ≈øeek righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe by the Law, do make but one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ≈øeed.</p>

               <p>Secondly, con≈øider next, that when God ≈øaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ≈øeed;</hi> look what ≈øeed is there meant, the ≈øame is meant in this place of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> chap. 3.16.

That ye may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter di≈øcern the force of this rea≈øon, con≈øider how the Apo≈øtle in treating of ju≈øtification, delivers this heavenly doctrine; that a ≈øinner is ju≈øtified by faith alone in Chri≈øt, without works. Now hee makes an objection; True, might ≈øome ≈øay, before the giving of the Law, ju≈øtification was by free promi≈øe, but when the Law was given, then there was another way of ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication appointed, at lea≈øt to joyn works with the promi≈øe; and the former way of ju≈øtification by free grace was di≈øanulled by the latter, that is, the bringing in of the Law; here is the force of the objection.</p>
               <p>Now, if we ≈øhall conceive the promi≈øe was made to one ≈øeed, and the covenant of the Law given to another, and not both of them to the ≈øame ≈øeed, then there is no colour of rea≈øon in the Apo≈øtles objection; for if the promi≈øe of Grace was given to one ≈øeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, to Chri≈øt per≈øonall, and the covenant of the Law given to another ≈øeed, then one need not di≈øanull the other, but they may both ≈øtand together; for if a man make two different covenants with two ≈øeverall per≈øons, they may both ≈øtand, the one not impeaching the other; but here is the ≈øtrength of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is ≈øuppo≈øed, that the two covenants are made with the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113533:29"/> ≈øame per≈øons, and then there is ≈øome ≈øeeming appearance of one di≈øanulling the other; therefore the ≈øtrength of the objection infers cleerly, that both the promi≈øe of Grace, and covenant of the Law, was made to the ≈øame per≈øons, to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ≈øeed, to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which are the children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Thus this objection is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, and the doctrine confirmed; that what≈øoever ≈øalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe but enter into covenant with God, and keepe it with him, and then be confident of all that rich ble≈ø≈øing which the Lord hath promi≈øed to his people. There is a promi≈øe made to Chri≈øt, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 49.7. that though he was de≈øpi≈øed of men, and abhorred of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and contemned by the rulers, yet (though it was very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in rea≈øon) Kings and Princes ≈øhould bow downe to him, and wor≈øhip him. But how ≈øhall this be brought to pa≈ø≈øe? this ≈øhall be done, ≈øaith the Text, <hi>becau≈øe of the Lord that is faithfull.</hi> So though
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113533:32"/> we be poore wormes, yet the Lord hath promi≈øed to us life and glory, and a Kingdome; But can this be accompli≈øhed to ≈øuch as we be? Yes, becau≈øe of the faithfulne≈ø≈øe of God, who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, and undertaken to performe it. Therefore if God have made thee mindfull and carefull of his covenant, to walke in obedience to him, then know that the Lord is more mindfull of his owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with thee, to performe to thee all that mercy and ble≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe which he hath promi≈øed to thee; and let this be a pledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee of the accompli≈øhment of all, even the care that God hath put in thy heart to walke in Covenant with him. Thus wee have heard the fourth generall ob≈øervation, noted out of the Text. But now by occa≈øion thereof, wee will lanch a little further into the deepe, having ≈øailed by the ≈øhore all this while, and enter into a con≈øideration more particularly of the nature of that Covenant, by which God conveyes life and ≈øalvation to his people.</p>
               <p>There are two covenants which the Scripture makes mention of, one of workes, the other of grace; of both the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeakes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.23, 24. The one is the Te≈øtament or Covenant of the Law, that ≈øhuts up all under wrath, the other of grace, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes libertie; the one is u≈øually called the commandement, the other the promi≈øe; the one is contained in the Law, the other in the Go≈øpel.</p>
               <p>Now if it be demanded, what covenant it is by which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates ≈øalvation to us:</p>
               <p>I an≈øwer, it is the covenant of grace, and not the covenant of workes, by which the ble≈ø≈øing of life and ≈øalvation cometh.</p>
               <p>For the more di≈øtinct handling whereof, wee mu≈øt con≈øider the≈øe two things ≈øeverally.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, To ≈øhew what the Covenant of grace is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To ≈øhew that the Lord communicates his ≈øalvation by the covenant of grace, and not of workes.</p>
               <p>Concerning the former, that wee may di≈øcerne what is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Covenant of grace; this I will ≈øet forth by con≈øidering the≈øe five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By comparing the covenant of grace with the covenant of workes; ≈øhewing both wherein they are alike, &amp; wherein they differ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By ≈øhewing the divers di≈øpen≈øations of the covenant, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chri≈øt, and ≈øince Chri≈øts coming.</p>

               <p n="5">5. By noting out the properties of the Covenant.</p>

               <p n="3">3. They agree in one common end, which is, that God may be glorified in his creature, in the manife≈øtation either of his ju≈øtice or mercy, according to the nature of the Covenant made with him, the glorifying of God is the common end of both.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>I an≈øwer, It is; but fir≈øt, it is not the ≈øame faith; ≈øecondly, nor required for the ≈øame end, as in the Covenant of grace. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine this, I ≈øay, the Covenant of workes requires faith, and that in a threefold act thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of dependance upon God, the fountaine and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all good, wee were not in our fir≈øt and be≈øt being which wee had by creation, wee were not (I ≈øay) ≈øo perfect, but wee ≈øtood in need ≈øtill to depend upon him that had created us, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that being which he had given us. It is imprinted in the nature of every creature to depend for ≈øu≈øtentation upon that from whence it had its beginning; as the chicken upon the hen, &amp;c. So the whole creation lookes backe unto him that made it for pre≈øervation in their being, as <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 104.21.27. <hi>&amp; P≈øal.</hi> 145.15. And if it be ≈øo in the≈øe unrea≈øonable creatures, thus to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Creator, then was the ≈øame in man much more; the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Law required this faith of man in the beginning, though now we be as Gods in our owne eyes, ≈øelfe-≈øufficient, depending
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113533:34"/> upon our ≈øelves, and none el≈øe, for all the good wee hope for; yet at the beginning it was not ≈øo. But man was to depend upon God for his being, and well-being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another act of faith required in the Law, was a per≈øwa≈øion that God was well plea≈øed with him, whil≈øt he walked in the way of love and obedience to his creator, he was to believe without feare and doubt, that ≈øo long as he obeyed the will of the Lord, he was well-plea≈øed with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He was to believe the ble≈ø≈øing of life promi≈øed in that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to expect it according to the promi≈øe. In all the≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards faith was commanded in the Covenant of workes.</p>
               <p>It may here be demanded; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> If faith be required in the covenant of workes, why is it not expre≈ø≈øed in plaine words, as well as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? the Covenant of workes ≈øaith; <hi>Thou ≈øhalt love the Lord thy God, and ≈øerve him;</hi> but it doth not call for any act of faith at all.</p>
               <p>The rea≈øon thereof is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An≈øw. </seg>
                  </label> becau≈øe when the Covenant of workes was made with man, he was then in his integritie, ≈øinne was not yet come into the world, and therefore there was no cau≈øe for man to doubt of Gods love, and acceptation of him. But having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ≈øo great benefits from God, made after his image, but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the Angels, and having dominion given him over all the workes of Gods hands, he was now to be put in minde of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards his creator, and therefore was to be ≈øtirred up to love, honour and obey him, no need was there to ≈øtirre him up to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Gods goodne≈ø≈øe towards him, of which he had no cau≈øe to doubt. But when God cometh to make a Covenant of grace with man, he finds him in his ≈øin and rebellion, full of feares and doubts, and therefore had need to be encouraged to believe that God will be reconciled; but then it was not ≈øo, there was then nothing to cau≈øe di≈øtru≈øt, and therefore faith was not expre≈ø≈øed in that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet faith was then required, as wee have ≈øhewed, though <hi>not the ≈øame faith</hi> that is required in the covenant of grace. But they differ in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The covenant of workes commandeth faith in God as a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to pre≈øerve our being, but not as a redeemer to deliver us from mi≈øery. <hi>Adam</hi> was not bound to believe on God as a redeemer; for then he needed no redemption. But the Covenant of grace, requires faith in God as a redeemer; redeeming us from ≈øinne and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113533:35"/> mi≈øery. The <hi>Jewes</hi> profe≈ø≈øed they believed on God, but by what faith? When the faith of the Go≈øpel was preached unto them by Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, they counted it a ≈øtrange thing, they clave to the Covenant of workes, they therefore believed on God as a Creator, but believed not on grace revealed in the Go≈øpel; by this faith they believed not on him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant of workes required faith to believe in God loving mee, as created holy, and continuing in the ≈øame puritie and holine≈ø≈øe before him, and no further; but the Covenant of grace commands faith to believe in God loving us, and pitying us lo≈øt ≈øinners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The faith required in the Covenant of workes, was mutable, as now all the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe required in that Covenant, and ≈øo might be lo≈øt, as afterwards it was by the ≈øinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> but the faith required in the Covenant of grace, is ≈øuch as is begotten of an immortall ≈øeed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. and therefore cannot be lo≈øt, but abide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and continues for ever; It is a faith that cannot faile, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Thus yee ≈øee the ≈øame faith is not required in both Covenants; Secondly, It is not required in the Covenant of grace for the ≈øame end as it was in the Covenant of workes; In the Covenant of workes, faith was required as a part of that righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe which the Law required, it is one of the duties of the Law; but in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace it is required not as any part of our righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, but onely as an in≈øtrument to receive and apprehend the righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe which is wrought for us by Chri≈øt; and therefore the faith required in the Covenant of workes, was a giving unto God, but the faith required in the Covenant of grace, is onely a receiving from God, that which he freely offers us.</p>

But marke the difference.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covenant of workes doth not require workes for the ≈øame end, as the Covenant of grace, for that requires workes as the matter of our ju≈øtification before God; ≈øo ≈øaith <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding him in a Legall way) <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. la≈øt, <hi>This is your righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe;</hi> but the Covenant of grace requires workes not as a part of our righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, but that thereby wee ≈øhould glorifie God, and manife≈øt it that wee are made righteous by Chri≈øt, <hi>James</hi> 2. wee are thereby declared to be righteous; the godly conver≈øation of a Chri≈øtian maketh it evident to the con≈øciences of men, that he is a ju≈øtified man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The workes that are required in the Covenant of grace, are not required from the ≈øame beginning; the Covenant of workes requires workes to be performed from our own ≈øtrength and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie received in the Creation, it pre≈øuppo≈øeth abilitie in our ≈øelves to doe what it requireth. But the Covenant of grace requireth workes to be done by the help of the Spirit of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can doe all things,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>through Chri≈øt ≈øtrengthning mee,</hi> that is, the power which the Covenant of grace directs us unto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Covenant of grace doth not require works in the ≈øame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as the Covenant of workes doth, for the Covenant of workes requires workes fir≈øt, and then faith to believe our ≈øelves beloved unto life; but the Covenant of grace requireth faith fir≈øt, and then that we bring forth good workes; therefore ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle (<hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Let them which have believed, be carefull to ≈øhew forth good workes:</hi> He doth not ≈øay, Let them which have done good workes, believe; but fir≈øt believe and then doe good workes, he placeth faith before workes; and hence it is that the obedience of the Go≈øpel, is called <hi>the obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26. as following faith and ≈øpringing from it. Thus then this difference of the condition of the Covenants remaineth; the one Covenant commanding workes, the other faith.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Differ. </seg>2</label> The ≈øecond maine difference is this, namely, that the Covenant of workes is made without a Mediator, to mediate between God and man. But in the Covenant of grace there is a Mediator com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between, to unite God and man together, and make them one. Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. Chri≈øt is called <hi>the Mediator of the new Te≈øtament;</hi> ≈øo al≈øo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. but the fir≈øt Covenant of workes had no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The rea≈øon of this difference is, becau≈øe when God came to make a covenant of workes with <hi>Adam,</hi> then there was no di≈øagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between God and man, man was yet righteous, per≈øi≈øting in that innocency and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe in which he was created, there was yet no breach made, the heart and mind of man an≈øwering to the mind of God, and therefore there was no need of a Mediator to bring them together; But when the Covenant of grace is made with man, there is a former breach between God and him, and ≈øo there is need of a third partie, of a Mediator to make them one. Hence is that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>A Mediator is not a Mediator of one;</hi> whiles wee are one with God, there is no need of a Mediator, no more then there is need for one to mediate between a man and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, (this is the ordinary interpretation of that place, though it may probably beare another ≈øen≈øe) and ≈øo it was betwixt God and man in the beginning, there was no variance then between them by ≈øinne, then God made a Covenant with man, as with his friend, as <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>the friend of God,</hi> but when ≈øin had made a breach between God and man, then ≈øtrangene≈ø≈øe and enmitie followed, God is e≈øtranged from us, and wee are enemies unto God, ≈øo that without a Mediator, wee can never come to be united into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant againe. Now man feares and trembles to come before God, and God being offended, cannot be at peace, unle≈ø≈øe his Ju≈øtice be ≈øatisfied; Therefore when <hi>Adam</hi> had once ≈øinned, he feared to come
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:113533:36"/> into the pre≈øence of God, and hid him≈øelfe, till God revealed and made knowne to him the Mediator of the Covenant, that <hi>the Seed of the woman ≈øhould breake the Serpents head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenant of workes was delivered to the children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> by the hand of a Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and ≈øo the difference is taken away.</p>
               <p>I grant the Covenant of workes was then revealed and made <label type="milestone">

This is evident by that of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Wherefore then ≈øerveth the Law?</hi> The Apo≈øtle had before proved that wee are ju≈øtified by faith in the free promi≈øe, and not by workes; ≈øome then might object, Why was the Law then given to the children of <hi>I≈ørael?</hi> The Apo≈øtle an≈øwers, it was given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraine tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, to convince men of ≈øin, and to be as a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma≈øter to bring them to Chri≈øt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24.

               <p>The Law is to be con≈øidered two wayes; Fir≈øt, Ab≈øolutely, and by it ≈øelfe, as containing a Covenant of workes: Secondly, Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and with re≈øpect to the Covenant of grace.</p>

And indeed, if wee ≈øo con≈øider it ≈øimply by it ≈øelfe, it doth containe nothing but a covenant of workes, and begets children to bondage, which ≈øhall have no inheritance with the children of promi≈øe, which lay hold of the new Covenant; but yet the former truth ≈øtill holds firme, and un≈øhaken, namely, that it was not a Covenant of workes, as it had re≈øpect to that people, that is, it was not given to them with intent that they ≈øhould looke to be ju≈øtified, and to live thereby, but onely to lead them to Chri≈øt, and to re≈øtraine tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, as the Apo≈øtle fully ≈øhewes in the third Chapter. This two-fold con≈øideration of the Law here ≈øpoken of, is evident to any that doth with attention read tho≈øe two Chapters, and attends to the ≈øcope of them; for that which the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeakes concerning the Law, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> being under the Law, Chap. 4.1, 2, 3. &amp;c. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of tho≈øe that are under it, as under a Covenant of workes, but of tho≈øe that were children of God by grace, though yet under age, &amp;c.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113533:41"/> cannot be applyed otherwi≈øe then to the children of the Law and Covenant of workes, ≈øtrictly and properly ≈øo called. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this two-fold con≈øideration of the Law is grounded upon the Text it ≈øelfe. And the Apo≈øtle ari≈øeth from one of the≈øe unto the other; Fir≈øt, ≈øpeaking of the Law as it had reference to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ≈øhewing for what end it was given unto them, which he handles Chapter 3.17. to Chap. 4.21. and then falls to an ab≈øolute con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of it in it ≈øelfe, ≈øhewing the danger of being under the Law, being ≈øo con≈øidered ≈øimply as a covenant of workes, namely, that it ca≈øts us out of the inheritance, which is given onely to the children of promi≈øe; the Covenant then which God made with <hi>I≈ørael</hi> at <hi>Sinai,</hi> was a covenant of grace, God renewing with them the former covenant made before with them in <hi>Abraham,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all did then ≈øhew them the covenant of workes, what it was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to force them to cleave unto the former promi≈øe of grace.</p>
               <p>The ≈øumme is, that though the Law (which containes the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes) was delivered to the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> by a Mediator, <hi>(Mo≈øes)</hi> by rea≈øon of that reference it had in them to the covenant of grace, yet was it not ≈øo given by a Mediator un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom it was given as a meere covenant of workes, by which he ≈øhould live. And in this appeares the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one Covenant and the other, the covenant of workes is without a Mediator, there being no breach between God and man, when the covenant of workes was given. But the covenant of grace is by a Mediator, to make up the breach which ≈øin hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, ≈øo as now in this e≈øtate of ≈øin, there is no peace with God, no ble≈ø≈øing from God, but it mu≈øt be obtained by the Mediator between God and man, Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Hence is that, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2.13.16.18. where the Apo≈øtle ≈øhewes how both Jewes and Gentiles are made neere to God <hi>by Chri≈øt; Wee were aliens and ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but now are made Citizens with the Saints, and of the hou≈øhold of God, and have entrance and acce≈ø≈øe to the Father</hi> by Chri≈øt. Neither is there any other ble≈ø≈øing to be looked for, but as it comes to us through the hand of the Mediator; he it is that <hi>hath received gifts for men,</hi> P≈øal. 68.18. and he <hi>gives gifts to men,</hi> Eph. 4.8. by him <hi>wee have remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes,</hi> Eph. 1.7. by him <hi>wee receive the Spirit of life and grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. By him the Mediator, wee enter and are brought into covenant with God; by him we are kept in covenant
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113533:41"/> with him; by him wee receive all the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant; and without a Mediator there is no peace, no ble≈ø≈øing to be looked for. All the promi≈øes of the Covenant are made by him, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.) In him they are <hi>yea and Amen:</hi> though every promi≈øe doe not by name mention Chri≈øt, yet it hath re≈øpect unto Chri≈øt, and without Chri≈øt wee can receive nothing that comes in the nature of a ble≈ø≈øing, or that comes from grace.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Differ. </seg>3</label> The third difference between the Covenant of workes, and of grace, is this; That in the covenant of workes Gods acceptation begins with the worke, and ≈øo goes on to the worker or per≈øon working; But in the covenant of grace, his acceptation begins with the per≈øon, and ≈øo goes on unto the worke; In the one God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the per≈øon for the workes ≈øake: In the other, God rewards the worke for the per≈øons ≈øake.

                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, a gift, as being freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the per≈øon, without re≈øpect to any worke, or if to the work, yet for the per≈øons ≈øake. This word <hi>(gratis)</hi> freely, puts the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the covenant of workes and of grace. In the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of work, God ju≈øtifies the doers of the Law, but not <hi>(gratis)</hi> freely; but in the covenant of grace God ju≈øtifies freely, without re≈øpect to the worke, out of love to the per≈øon. This is noted in the ≈øpeech of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> concerning <hi>Abel;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>God had re≈øpect to Abel, and to his ≈øacrifice; Abel</hi> being a believer, and under grace, God had re≈øpect to his ≈øacrifice, but it was becau≈øe he fir≈øt had re≈øpect to <hi>Abel</hi> him≈øelfe. Hence al≈øo is that argument of theirs in <hi>Judges</hi> 13.23.<note place="margin">Judg. 13.23.</note> 
                  <hi>If</hi> (≈øay they) <hi>the Lord would ≈ølay us, he would not have accepted an offering at our hands.</hi> They rea≈øon from the acceptance of their ≈øervice, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of their per≈øon; becau≈øe the per≈øon is accepted fir≈øt, and therefore if the offering be accepted, then the per≈øon much more.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:113533:43"/> But on the contrary, the Lord threatneth, that when he tooke no plea≈øure in their per≈øons,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.10.</note> then their offerings ≈øhould not be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ≈øo when <hi>Elijah</hi> and the Prie≈øts of <hi>Baal</hi> offered the ≈øame kinde of ≈øacrifice, God accepted the ≈øacrifice of <hi>Elijah,</hi> but not of the other, becau≈øe his per≈øon was accepted, but theirs were not. In 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.52.<note place="margin">1 King 8.52.</note> God is ≈øaid to have his eyes open to heare the prayers of his people; it is not the eye which heares, but the eare; yet God is ≈øaid to have his eyes open to heare our prayers, becau≈øe there is ≈øomething fir≈øt in Gods eye, which makes his eare to li≈øten unto our cry: Fir≈øt he looks favourably upon our per≈øons, and hath a gracious re≈øpect unto our ≈øelves, and then he bowes his eare to the prayer which we make before him. According to that, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 34.15.<note place="margin">P≈øal. 34.15.</note> 
                  <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his eare is open to their prayers.</hi> Thus it is in the Covenant of grace, Gods acceptance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth fir≈øt with the per≈øon. And hence it is that when God hath ca≈øt favour upon the per≈øon, then he accepts weake ≈øervices from them. A cup of cold water is better accepted from ≈øuch an one,<note place="margin">Mat. to la≈øt. Micah 6.6, 7.</note> then a thou≈øand rivers of oyle from another hand; yea though there be imperfections and weakne≈ø≈øes in the thing done, yet God pa≈ø≈øeth by the weakne≈ø≈øes for the favour he beares unto the per≈øon. As wee may ≈øee in <hi>Jacob,</hi> he ≈øeekes the ble≈ø≈øing, but mixeth ≈øo much imperfection and ≈øin in it, that if God had not accepted his per≈øon, he might have brought a cur≈øe upon him≈øelfe in ≈øtead of a ble≈ø≈øing; but God had ≈øaid, <hi>Jacob have I loved,</hi> and therefore though he liked not his di≈ø≈øembling, yet he pa≈ø≈øed by his infirmitie, and <hi>Jacob</hi> got the ble≈ø≈øing.

                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 11. ult.</note> though the thing which he had done di≈øplea≈øed the Lord, yet God tooke not his mercy from him, as he tooke it from <hi>Saul;</hi> for <hi>Saul</hi> was under a covenant of workes, and <hi>David</hi> under a covenant of grace.

                  <hi>I will be mercifull to your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> &amp;c. The Covenant of Works forgiveth no ≈øin, there is nothing but ≈øtrict ju≈øtice in that Covenant. In this Covenant, God looks not at any mans repentance and turning from ≈øin, but only con≈øiders, whether he hath ≈øinned: As in Courts of Ju≈øtice, where there are tried matters of life and death, there is no regard had, whether the party be penitent, or no, but whether the fact be committed, and if found guilty, he is led to execution; ≈øo in Gods Court of Ju≈øtice, which he keeps according to the tenor of the Covenant of Works, Ju≈øtice acts and doth all. Ju≈øtice indictes, Ju≈øtice examines, Ju≈øtice pronounceth ≈øentence, Ju≈øtice executes the puni≈øhment; and ≈øo who≈øoever hath ≈øinned, receives according to the evil that he hath done. And hence it is, that when <hi>Adam</hi> had ≈øinned, the inqui≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not, whether he repented him of the evill that he had done;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:113533:46"/> but, what ha≈øt thou done? Ha≈øt thou eaten of the tree, whereof I ≈øaid unto thee, thou ≈øhalt not eat? And the Lord finding that he had offended, pronounces cur≈øes and death. But in the Covenant of Grace it is otherwi≈øe. There God looks at the repentance of his people, and accepts of humiliation, and faith in Chri≈øt. Hence is the coun≈øell of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.<note place="margin">Acts 2.37.</note> 
                  <hi>Repent, and be baptized,</hi> &amp;c. When they ≈øaw the horrible ≈øin which they had done, in killing the Lord of life, they being the children of the Covenant, he tels them, that yet there was mercy for them, they might obtain forgivene≈ø≈øe of ≈øins. Hence al≈øo, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.10.<note place="margin">Jonah 3.10.</note> when God ≈øaw their repentance, and that they turned from their evill wayes, he al≈øo turned from the evill which he ≈øaid he would do to them, and did it not.

                  <hi>The Lord gracious and mercifull, ≈ølow to anger,</hi> yet not acquitting the wicked, but vi≈øiting iniquitie, &amp;c. In one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, God condemnes both ≈øin and ≈øinner; in the other, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes the ≈øin, but ≈øpares, and gives life to the ≈øinner, to glorifie his grace thereby. In the Covenant of workes, he aymes to make his power and ju≈øtice knowne; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 2.5.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.22. &amp; cap. 2.5.</note> But in the other, to glorifie grace; as <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 48.9. &amp; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6.

And therefore to limit Gods grace, as we are apt to doe, is in effect to turne the Covenant of grace into a Covenant of workes, as if there were no more grace under the one, then under the other.

This dubious anxiety, doth the Doctrine and Covenant of workes leave a man in; but the Covenant of grace takes away all the≈øe ≈øcruples; It ≈øaith not, <hi>Who ≈øhall goe up into heaven, &amp;c.</hi> It tells us, that Chri≈øt is a≈øcended to prepare a place for us; nor ≈øaith it, <hi>Who ≈øhall de≈øcend, &amp;c.</hi> It teacheth us to believe, that Chri≈øt is de≈øcended for to deliver us; So that this doctrine of grace frees the minde of tho≈øe ≈øcruples and perplexities, which the doctrine of workes leaves a man intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in.

And therefore comes to Chri≈øt, to know what more he ≈øhould doe be≈øide what he had done alreadie. The Papi≈øts, who build upon their workes, teach a doctrine of doubting; No man (≈øay they) can come to be a≈ø≈øured and ≈øetled in an undoubted per≈øwa≈øion of his own ≈øalvation; and well may they teach ≈øuch a doctrine, when they build upon ≈øuch a ≈øandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own workes.

Though it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed before, yet it was but darkly, but now it is revealed more clearly ≈øince the coming of our Saviour Chri≈øt; ≈øo al≈øo <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 3, 4, 5.<note place="margin">Ephe≈ø. 3.4, 5.</note> and <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 2.26.<note place="margin">Colo≈ø. 2.26.</note> Con≈øider the truth of this in ≈øome particulars.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider the promi≈øe of eternall life, it was darkly cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over, not clearly promi≈øed to them: The promi≈øe of eternall life is very rarely in expre≈ø≈øe termes mentioned in the old Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I know but one place (which is in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2.<note place="margin">Dan. 12.2.</note>) where plaine mention is made of life eternall. It was ≈øhadowed out to them in the promi≈øe of inhabiting in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was a ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of eternall life; ≈øo the threatning of eternall death, was typed out by the threatning of exclu≈øion out of the Lords Land. <hi>Ho≈øea</hi> 9.3.<note place="margin">Ho≈øea 9.3.</note> When they ≈øhould be driven into captivity, it was a type of their ≈øending into hell, if they did not returne to walke with him in his Covenant. And hence are tho≈øe promi≈øes, <hi>They ≈øhall inherite the land, and dwell in the earth,</hi> P≈øal. 37.11.<note place="margin">P≈øal. 37.11.</note> Not as if that were all they were to looke for, but becau≈øe it was the type of another and better inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in heaven. This was the cau≈øe that made <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49.29.<note place="margin">Gen. 49.29.</note> give that charge to his ≈øonnes, that they ≈øhould not bury him in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but carry him into the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> Gen. 50.24, 25. tooke an oath of his brethren, that they ≈øhould carry his bones with them; And why was this done, but becau≈øe they looked at that Land as more then an earthly po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, taking it as a type of heaven, and by giving that charge, they te≈øtified their faith in the promi≈øe of God concerning the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of life eternall? Therefore al≈øo it was that <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he indured many troubles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries in the land of promi≈øe, and had time to have returned into his own Country, yet he would not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.15.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.15.</note> becau≈øe he looked at that, as a land of promi≈øe, and a type of the re≈øt that remained
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:113533:62"/> for him in the kingdome of God. Thus was the promi≈øe of eternall life ob≈øcurely propounded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Con≈øider the revealing of Chri≈øt, either the per≈øon of Chri≈øt, or his offices, and wee ≈øhall ≈øee that they were darkly propounded unto them in re≈øpect of what they are to us. Chri≈øt was but ≈øhadowed out to them in types, and figures, and dark pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øies. Concerning, his per≈øon it was revealed unto them that he ≈øhould be God, as <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 9.6.<note place="margin">I≈øai. 9.6.</note> where he is called <hi>the mighty God;</hi> and al≈øo that he ≈øhould be man, and therefore ≈øaid to be borne, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 9.6. But how he ≈øhould be both God and man in one per≈øon, was very darkly revealed. Which made the <hi>Jewes</hi> that they could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to that que≈øtion, how Chri≈øt ≈øhould be both Lord and ≈øonne to <hi>David.</hi> So for his offices; his Mediator≈øhip was typed out by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> his being between God and the people; his Prie≈øthood typed out by <hi>Melchi≈øedek</hi> among the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and his ≈øacrifice by their ≈øacrifices: his Propheticall office ≈øhadowed to them by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> who revealed the minde of God to the people. Therefore ≈øaith <hi>Mo≈øes, Deut.</hi> 18.18.<note place="margin">Deut. 18.18.</note> 
                  <hi>A Prophet ≈øhall the Lord your God rai≈øe up unto you like unto me;</hi> which is applyed unto Chri≈øt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22.<note place="margin">Acts 3.22.</note> His Kingly office typed out in the kingdome of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Luk. 1.31.<note place="margin">Luk. 1.31.32.</note> 
                  <hi>God ≈øhall give him the kingdome of his Father David.</hi> But how darke the≈øe things were unto them, you may perceive by the ≈øpeeches of the Di≈øciples unto Chri≈øt, who knew not how he ≈øhould execute tho≈øe offices, they knew not that he ≈øhould dye, they dreamt of an earthly kingdome; they ≈øaw Chri≈øt under a vaile, but wee ≈øee him with open face, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The benefits that come by Chri≈øt were not ≈øo clearly made knowne to them as they are to us. Ju≈øtification was ≈øignified by the ≈øprinkling of the bloud of the ≈øacrifice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.7, 8.<note place="margin">Exod. 24, 7, 8.</note> So ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification was typed out by the water of purification; The benefits which are ≈øo clearly revealed unto us, that Chri≈øt is our wi≈ødome, righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, ≈øanctification, and redemption, were but darkly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto them. So that the light now is become like the light at noone day, the light that they had was but like the dawning of the day, or the light of the ≈øtarres. Hence is that of Chri≈øt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16, 17. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are your eyes, for they ≈øee, and your eares, for they heare, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The Church was then in its minority and infancy, but now it is of full age, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2.<note place="margin">Galat. 4.1, 2.</note> Therefore as a Father gives ≈øome hints of his purpo≈øe and will, to his childe when he is under age, but makes knowne all his minde to him when he is growne up; ≈øo dealt the Lord with his Church then, as with children, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

It was not meet that all ≈øhould be revealed before his coming, but that he ≈øhould have the glory of revealing tho≈øe deepe things which were hid with God, making them knowne to his Church and people. And therefore they were more darkly revealed before. Onely this ob≈øerve, that the further the times were from Chri≈øts coming, the le≈ø≈øe light they had, and the nearer to Chri≈øt, the more light ≈øprung up. The promi≈øe to <hi>Eve</hi> was more darke, more cleare to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ≈øtill more cleare to <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. And the rea≈øon of this is,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe Chri≈øt is the light of the world; Now as the Sunne the further it is from ri≈øing, the le≈ø≈øe light it gives, and the nearer to ri≈øing, the more, ≈øo did Chri≈øt the Sun of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Before the Law was given, there was le≈ø≈øe ≈øen≈øe of ≈øin, and therefore the le≈ø≈øe revelation of Chri≈øt: But as the ≈øen≈øe of ≈øin increa≈øed by the revelation of the Law, ≈øo there was more cleare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Chri≈øt to them; Though at the be≈øt, it was but darke in compari≈øon of what it is now in the dayes of the New Te≈øtament.</p>

                  <hi>Lord, why is it that thou wilt reveale thy ≈øelfe to us and not to the world?</hi> Count it not a ≈ømall mercy, that wee have Chri≈øt revealed ≈øo clearly now more then formerly.

                  <note place="margin">I≈øai. 52.8.</note> though ≈øomething more may be added in the conver≈øion of the Jewes.

               <p>Fir≈øt, grow up in the knowledge of the covenant, and of the ble≈ø≈øings of it. We ≈øhould not now bee ignorant of what God hath promi≈øed on his part, nor what he requires on our part. If we have any intimation given us of a Legacy in ≈øome rich mans will, O how carefull are we to enquire into it! How much more ≈øhould we labour to know this Te≈øtament?</p>
               <p>Secondly, labour al≈øo to grow ≈øetled in the doctrine which the covenant teacheth us, not being carried away with every new fangled conceit, but grounded in the truth which you have received. Be children in malice, but in knowledge and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be men of ripe age, able to di≈øcerne between things that differ, and to try all things holding fa≈øt that which is good. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe we doe thus,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, we lo≈øe the benefit of the dayes of light in which we live, if we be ≈øtill ignorant of the covenant, and of the benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be received, and live not by faith in them, as good we had never heard them, we take Gods grace in vain: In vain ≈øhould the Sunne ri≈øe and give light, if wee ≈øhut our eyes, and will not ≈øee it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we be ≈øtill ignorant of the doctrine of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and un≈øetled, it argues a ≈øinfull neglect, and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the grace of God, and of the light we enjoy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as men open their windowes when the day appeareth,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:113533:63"/> though they had drawn their curtains before, ≈øo let us open our eyes to di≈øcerne the doctrine of the grace of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if any be now ignorant and ungrounded in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of grace, it is a token of a dangerous e≈øtate: therefore ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>If our Go≈øpel be now hid, it is bid to them that are lo≈øt, in whom the God of this world, &amp;c.</hi> And ≈øo for ungrounded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, ≈øee what the Apo≈øtle <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>That they that are un≈øtable and pervert the Scriptures, doe it to their own de≈øtruction.</hi> Seeing the doctrine of grace is ≈øo clearly manife≈øted, let us labour to know it, and to be ≈øtabli≈øhed therein, that ≈øo we may turn nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the right hand nor to the left.</p>
               <p>Seeing the light of grace doth more clearly ≈øhine now then in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">∆≤≈øe </seg>2</label> dayes before, let us therefore goe on in our way with more ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and cheerfulne≈ø≈øe of ≈øpirit, we having the day-light ≈øhining to us and guiding us. The light of the Lord is ri≈øen up on high to guide our feet into the way of peace. Therefore as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, though they walk heavily and uncomfortably whiles they are compa≈ø≈øed with darkne≈ø≈øe, yet when light appeares, they goe cheerfully: ≈øo we that are pilgrimes and travellers, ≈øhould rejoyce that the day is come, as they that ≈øailed with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 27. we ≈øhould rejoyce in the light, ≈øtriving again≈øt all di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements we meet withall, and walking on cheerfully in the way that is ≈øet before us.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">∆≤≈øe </seg>3</label> we have our way ≈øo plain before us. It is no wonder if they that be in the dark ≈øtumble, they cannot ≈øee the blocks that be in their way, but they that walk in the day ≈øtumble not: So it ≈øhould be with us, we ≈øhould now labour to take heed of offences, both of giving and taking offences cau≈øle≈øly.<note place="margin">John 11.9.10</note> Endeavour to walk <hi>inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo pede:</hi> If we ≈øtumble, it is not for want of light, but of heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe. Let us ≈øtrive to walk evenly, con≈øidering wee have more light then the Saints had formerly. Labour to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate pa≈ø≈øions and affections, pride, worldline≈ø≈øe, ≈øelf-willed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, emulation: keep the≈øe within, the≈øe ≈øhould be like the wild bea≈øts of the field, which retire to their dens when the Sunne ari≈øeth, they are afraid to bee ≈øeen in the light; ≈øo the≈øe wild lu≈øts of ours, ≈øhould not dare to appeare in the≈øe dayes of light, they cannot ≈øtirre forth but the light will di≈øcover them, ≈øinne is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:113533:64"/> now more con≈øpicuous, and more odious. Let us therefore walk ≈øoberly, mode≈øtly, and orderly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the third difference in the manner of di≈øpen≈øation is, in re≈øpect of power and efficacie. The di≈øpen≈øation of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant works more powerfully and ≈øtrongly now, then in the dayes before Chri≈øts comming: It was then more weak in the con≈øciences of Gods people then now, if we ≈øpeak of the body of them. Hence ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18.19. <hi>The commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment going before was di≈øanulled by rea≈øon of the weakne≈ø≈øe of it;</hi> It was not then ≈øimply and ab≈øolutely weak and unprofitable, ≈øo that it could not communicate life and ≈øalvation to any, but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively weak in re≈øpect of the lively and powerfull communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it now. Hence al≈øo, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.9.<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> they are called <hi>weak and beggerly rudiments.</hi> The covenant then did not bring men to that perfection in grace, as the new covenant doth.

                  </gap>e there was a le≈ø≈øe forcible influence of the Spirit accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the di≈øpen≈øation of the covenant then. The ≈øpirit was not then given in that large mea≈øure as now, becau≈øe Chri≈øt was not then glorified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. And becau≈øe the ≈øpirit was given in a le≈øs mea≈øure, therefore tho≈øe ordinances were le≈ø≈øe profitable. The liberall pouring out of the Spirit was re≈øerved unto the time of Chri≈øts a≈øcen≈øion, to the end it might bee known that it is from Chri≈øt glorified that we doe receive the Spirit, as <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>If I goe not away</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt) <hi>the holy Gho≈øt will not come. When Chri≈øt a≈øcended, then he gave plenitude of gifts to men, Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.7.8.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.7, 8.</note> Then the Spirit was ≈øhed down <hi>abundantly,</hi> as <hi>Titus</hi> 3.6.

               <p n="1">1. There was le≈øs power of faith in the Saints before Chri≈øt, then ≈øince.

               <p>The fourth difference is, in regard of the extent of it: The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace in the old di≈øpen≈øation of it, was revealed onely unto one people, the nation of the Jewes, but now it is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Gentiles al≈øo, and free to bee revealed to all nations.

                  <hi>Let us breake the≈øe bonds, and ca≈øt the≈øe cords from us.</hi> But if we look into the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant which it brings, the≈øe will make the bonds more ea≈øie, that the ≈øoule will ≈øay, Lord bind me as fa≈øt as thou wilt, that I may never ≈øtart from thee; knit my heart unto thee, that I may feare thee for ever. It will make the ≈øervice of the Covenant an ea≈øie ≈øervitude, yea it will make us ≈øee glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it. If this be con≈øidered, we ≈øhall not ≈øay, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. and <hi>Job</hi> 21.15. <hi>What profit is it, that wee have ≈øerved the Lord, and kept his ordinances, &amp;c?</hi> but that in <hi>keeping his Covenant there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> P≈øal. 19.<note place="margin">P≈øal. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whereas the Lord doth ca≈øt in many ble≈ø≈øings upon his people, ≈øpirituall and temporall, (the Lord dealing in all his wayes towards his people according to his Covenant with them) now the con≈øideration of the many ble≈ø≈øings which wee doe enjoy by the Covenant, will lead us to the right fountaine from whence we doe receive them, even to ≈øee the faithfulne≈ø≈øe of God in them, who keeps covenant and promi≈øe with his people; Wee ≈øhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ≈øee, that as he hath ≈øpoken it with his mouth, ≈øo he hath fulfilled it with his hand.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The knowledge of the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant will helpe to ≈øupport our faith in all tryalls, exigencies, and ≈øtraights, which we fall into; if we know what the promi≈øes of the covenant be, it will beare us up that our faith faint not, though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent we be cut ≈øhort of the ble≈ø≈øings which wee have a promi≈øe for. Herein faith is ≈øupported, that though God may try us, yet he will not for≈øake us, if the ble≈ø≈øing be not <hi>yet come,</hi> yet it <hi>will come,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile, the Covenant being faithfull; the Lord <hi>will</hi> perform mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to <hi>Jacob</hi> and truth to <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> Micah 7. la≈øt. Thus it is every way u≈øefull and profitable to know the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And here lift up our hearts to looke for great things, great ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings, ≈øuch as the great God hath promi≈øed; the ble≈ø≈øings are ≈øuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the per≈øon that we enter into Covenant withall; The things of the Covenant are great things, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 8.12.<note place="margin">Ho≈ø. 8.12.</note> Princes and Monarches when they enter into Covenant with other Nations, they doe not make Covenants about childrens toyes and light matters, but ≈øuch
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:113533:68"/> as concerne the welfare of the Kingdome; ≈øo when the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of heaven and earth enters into Covenant with us, it is about the great things of our ≈øalvation, the great things of heaven, yea of God him≈øelfe. The Covenant is full of ble≈ø≈øings, it is a rich ≈øtore-hou≈øe, repleni≈øhed with all manner of ble≈ø≈øings. It is not dry nor barren, but like the fat Olive or fruitfull Vine, the fruit whereof cheares the heart of God and man. God him≈øelfe is delighted in the communication of his grace to his people; and <hi>they</hi> are delighted with the participation of his grace from him. The Covenant is a tree of life to tho≈øe that feed upon it, they ≈øhall live for ever. It is a Well of ≈øalvation, <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 12.3.<note place="margin">I≈øai. 12.3.</note> It's a fountaine of good things to ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie every thir≈øtie ≈øoule, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1.<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> It is a trea≈øure full of goods, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.12. Here is un≈øearchable riches in this Covenant, which can never be emptied, nor come to an end. Our finite narrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtandings can never apprehend the infinite grace this Covenant containes, no more then an egge-≈øhell is able to containe the water of the whole Sea. Yet it is not in vaine to con≈øider them as wee are able to expre≈ø≈øe them, though they be above that which we are able to ≈øpeake or thinke. As <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> though he could not ≈øee Gods face, nor di≈øcerne his glory to the full, yet he was permitted to ≈øee his back parts; ≈øo we may take a little view of the ble≈ø≈øings promi≈øed, though the full cannot be ≈øeene. As in a Map, we have the bounds of a Lord≈øhip ≈øet forth, the rivers, woods, meadowes, pa≈øtures, &amp;c. the≈øe are ≈øeen darkly in the Map, but they are nothing to that when they are ≈øeen in their own beautie and greenne≈ø≈øe; to ≈øee the ≈øilver ≈øtreames in the rivers, the beautifull woods, the large medowes, fat pa≈øtures, and goodly orchards, which are farre more excellent in them≈øelves, then when they are ≈øeene in the Map. So we can ≈øhew you but a little Map of tho≈øe glorious things which the Covenant containes; but by that little that you doe ≈øee, you may be rai≈øed up to the con≈øideration of the things that are not ≈øeene, but are to be revealed in due time.</p>
               <p>Now the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant are infolded and wrapped up in the promi≈øes of it, every promi≈øe of Grace containing a ble≈ø≈øing in it, as every threatning of the Law contains a cur≈øe. They are now infolded in the promi≈øe, the time of unfolding is not yet come. The time of full di≈øcovery is when the heavens come to be folded up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.12.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.12.</note> then the promi≈øes ≈øhall be unfolden, and then wee ≈øhall
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:113533:69"/> fully ≈øee the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant: Wee have now a right and intere≈øt in them, which is ≈øafe and ≈øure, but as yet we have them but by promi≈øe onely; and therefore it is, that the termes of <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>promi≈øe,</hi> are taken for the ≈øame, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.<note place="margin">Ephe≈ø. 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. Hence al≈øo we are ≈øaid to be heires (in hope) of eternall life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7.<note place="margin">Titus 3.7.</note> not in pre≈øent po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, but in hope. Therefore if wee would ≈øee what are the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant, we mu≈øt looke into the promi≈øes; Now the promi≈øes and ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant, are of two ≈øorts; Fir≈øt, of things ≈øpirituall and eternall. Secondly, of things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that concerne this outward life. The ≈øpirituall ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant are chiefly comprehended in the≈øe places of Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31.33.<note place="margin">Jer 31.31.33.</note> 
                  <hi>This ≈øhall be my Covenant, ≈øaith the Lord, after tho≈øe dayes, I will put my Law in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ≈øhall be my people. And they ≈øhall teach no more every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ≈øaying, Know the Lord, for they ≈øhall all know me from the lea≈øt of them, to the greate≈øt of them; for I will forgive their iniquitie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ≈øinne no more.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27, 28.<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.25, 26, 27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Then will I ≈øprinkle cleane water upon you, and yee ≈øhall be cleane from all your filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and from all your Idolls will I clean≈øe you; A new heart al≈øo will I give you, &amp;c.</hi> So al≈øo, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.38, 39, 40. <hi>They ≈øhall be my people, and I will be their God: and I will give them one heart, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 17.7.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> 
                  <hi>I will be a God unto thee, and thy ≈øeed.</hi> The≈øe places compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ≈øuch other, doe expre≈ø≈øe the ≈øumme of all the great things promi≈øed in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Here is that great promi≈øe, <hi>I will be your God, and you ≈øhall be my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, But if any ≈øay, Alas, how can God be a God unto me ≈øo ≈øinfull as I am, that have ≈øinned &amp; provoked him as I have done, therefore to take away this, God ≈øaith, that ≈øhall not hinder, <hi>I will forgive your iniquities, and remember them no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, But if the ≈øoule ≈øay further, that though God ≈øhould take all my former ≈øinnes away, and pardon them, yet I have ≈øuch a ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wretched nature in me, that I ≈øhall breake out into new ≈øinnes again≈øt him, and bring a new guiltine≈ø≈øe upon my ≈øelfe; The Lord removes and takes away this al≈øo, and promi≈øeth that he will renew our natures, and give us hearts of fle≈øh, he will wa≈øh us from our fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thine≈ø≈øe, and write his law in our hearts, and inable us to keepe his Statutes, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:113533:69"/>
               <p>Fourthly, But becau≈øe ≈øome may yet ≈øay, Though God ≈øhould doe all this for me, yet ≈øuch is my infirmitie and weakne≈ø≈øe, that I ≈øhall depart againe from the Lord, I ≈øhall never hold out; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord makes an≈øwer to this al≈øo, and tells us that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart away from us, and that he will put ≈øuch a feare of him into our hearts, that <hi>wee ≈øhall never depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32.40.</p>
               <p>To begin with the fir≈øt, which is the great promi≈øe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> Gen. 17.7.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> Jer. 31.33.<note place="margin">Jer. 31.33.</note> This is ≈øet in the mid≈øt of the promi≈øes, as the heart in the mid≈øt of the body to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate life to all the re≈øt of the members; This promi≈øe hath influence into all the re≈øt; As Chri≈øt ≈øpeaking of the Commandements of the Law, calls that commandement of loving the Lord with all our heart, <hi>the great Commandement;</hi> ≈øo may this be called <hi>the great promi≈øe</hi> of the new-Covenant; <hi>It is as great as God is;</hi> He is an infinite God, the <hi>heaven of heavens is not able to contain him:</hi> Yet this promi≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines him, God ≈øhuts up him≈øelfe in it, <hi>I will be your God.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Here is ≈øufficiency.

It was no ≈ømall thing that the Lord would at fir≈øt enter into covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> though carrying upon him then the lively image and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentation of Gods holine≈ø≈øe, yet this was le≈ø≈øe wonderfull, a righteous God to be in covenant with righteous man, the holy God to be in covenant with man indued with the like holine≈ø≈øe: But this is the wonder of grace, that the ju≈øt and holy God ≈øhould enter into covenant with, and communicate him≈øelfe to ≈øuch ≈øinfull, polluted, loath≈øome, and unclean creatures as the ≈øonnes of men be. We might ju≈øtly have been left to the God of this world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> becau≈øe we had preferred him before the true God.

               <p>Thirdly, it is more grace ≈øtill, becau≈øe his entring into this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with us, his be≈øtowing of this grace, is of him≈øelfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of his own good will and plea≈øure, without our ≈øeeking or enquiring for him.

Now if we would know what this implies when the Lord ≈øayes, <hi>[I will be God unto thee,]</hi> wee mu≈øt fir≈øt con≈øider, what it is to be God; and then we ≈øhall ≈øee what it is that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øeth to be God unto us. Now to be God implies the≈øe three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To bee All-≈øufficient, both to his own Being and Ble≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and to the ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe of the creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To have all that ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe and ≈øufficiency, that is in him, from him≈øelfe, and not from another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To be God over all, to have dominion and ≈øoveraignty over all, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:113533:73"/>
               <p>To apply the≈øe things to the point in hand, That God will be a God to us, implies the≈øe three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he will be an All-≈øufficient God to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he will be all this good to us from him≈øelf, and from no other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he will be God over us, to bring us again under the fir≈øt dominion; as <hi>Micah.</hi> 4.8.<note place="margin">Micah 4.8.</note> to rule over us, and govern us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, for the fir≈øt, that God will be an All-≈øufficient God to us, this is a part of his covenant, that he will be to us a full ble≈ø≈øing, ≈øo as that we ≈øhall bee wanting in nothing that is good for us. Hence it is,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> that when God tells <hi>Abraham, He will be his God, and the God of his ≈øeed,</hi> if <hi>Abraham</hi> ≈øhould now ask what that is; ≈øaith God, ver≈øe 1. <hi>I am God All-≈øufficient,</hi> and al≈øo my goodne≈ø≈øe and ≈øufficiency is thine, I will bee enough to thee, thou ≈øhalt need no more.

               <p>Thirdly, becau≈øe what ever good is in the creature, is more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently and abundantly in God him≈øelfe: hee is the Fountain, and they are the Ci≈øterns. What ever good is in Angels or Men, or other creatures, is more abundantly in God.

               <p>Thirdly, there is in God a ≈øutablene≈ø≈øe to the de≈øires of the ≈øoul of man.

               <p>Fourthly, if God be our God, then all the creatures are ours, and for our good. If God bee ours, then all that is his is ours: now all the creatures are his. Hence ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>end; All things are yours.</hi> As when a virgin marrieth a Prince, his riches, glory, and all are for her good: So God having taken us into covenant with him≈øelfe, all that hee is, and hath, is for our comfort and ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>As God is <hi>able</hi> thus to be an All-≈øufficient God to us, ≈øo he <hi>will be</hi> to tho≈øe that are his.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, becau≈øe it is the nature of goodne≈ø≈øe to bee communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of it ≈øelf; and therefore God being good, he will let out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf unto his people. He cannot ≈øatisfie him≈øelf unle≈ø≈øe he doe it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lords end in taking us into covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, is to make us an happy and ble≈ø≈øed people, which wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but onely by the enjoyment of God him≈øelf; ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe ≈øtanding in a confluence of all good, which cannot be found but in God alone. There is in man him≈øelfe nothing but vanity and mi≈øery: he was at fir≈øt full of grace and goodne≈ø≈øe, an Image of the ble≈ø≈øed God, but now he is become a ≈øpectacle of mi≈øery. So all other things under the Sun are to him turned to vanity and vexation of ≈øpirit.

As we lo≈øt our felicity in lo≈øing God; ≈øo we mu≈øt recover it again by recovering him. Therefore wee find in experience, that the ≈øoule never finds ≈øetled te≈øt, till it come to re≈øt in God. As the Bee goes from flower to flower, becau≈øe there is not full contentment to be found in any one: ≈øo the ≈øoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from creature to creature, til it comes to God. Hence the Lord is called
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:113533:74"/> the <hi>re≈øt of the ≈øoule, P≈øalm</hi> 116.7. And this the Lord knowing, that the ≈øoule cannot find re≈øt any where el≈øe, but in him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>will</hi> communicate him≈øelf to them: this being his end, to make the creature bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>≈ø≈øed by enjoying of him.</p>
               <p>Con≈øider how God is an All-≈øufficient God to us in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects:</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, in re≈øpect of all our occa≈øions and nece≈ø≈øities, whatever our ca≈øe be. It's Gods prerogative alone to be an univer≈øal good. The things of the world can help but again≈øt ≈øome one thing; bread again≈øt hunger, drink again≈øt thir≈øt, cloathes again≈øt cold and nakedne≈ø≈øe, hou≈øes again≈øt wind and weather, friends again≈øt ≈øolitarine≈ø≈øe, riches again≈øt poverty, Phy≈øick again≈øt ≈øickne≈ø≈øe &amp;c. But God is an All-≈øufficient good, he ≈øupplies all the nece≈ø≈øities of his people, he is all in all to them, he is habitation to them, he is life, &amp;c. he doth good to the inward and outward man; his grace is ≈øufficient to help all the defects of the ≈øoule. Look upon the guilt of ≈øinne, there is abundant grace to pardon: Are our infirmities many? there is power in Gods grace to heale them. Are our corruptions ≈øtrong? the power of Gods Spirit can overcome them, and make us able to keep his Statutes and Judgements, and to doe them. Are our con≈øciences di≈øquieted, and our peace broken? His joy is able to make us rejoyce with joy un≈øpeakable and glorious.</p>
               <p>Again, his ≈øufficiency extends al≈øo to the body: all the welfare of the outward man is laid up in God; he is the God of our life, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 42.8.<note place="margin">P≈øalm 42.8.</note> and the ≈øtrength of our life, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 27.1.<note place="margin">P≈øalm 27.1.</note> He is a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ≈øpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.45.</note> which though it be true in regard of the inward man, which he doth al≈øo quicken by his Spirit and grace; yet it is there ≈øpoken of the outward man, of the body which the Lord ≈øhall quicken after death, and doth now keep alive by his power. <hi>For in him we live, and move, and have our being, Acts</hi> 17.28.<note place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note> When God formed the body at fir≈øt out of the du≈øt, whence had it life? Not from it ≈øelfe, nor from any creature: <hi>God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed into him the breath of life:</hi> and ≈øo he ≈øtill keeps the breath in our no≈øtrils, and upholds our ≈øoule in life, or el≈øe we ≈øhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently return to du≈øt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is an all-≈øufficient good in re≈øpect of all times and ≈øea≈øons, both for this life and the life to come. Other things
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:113533:74"/> ≈øerve but in their ≈øea≈øons, as it was ≈øaid of <hi>David,</hi> that he ≈øerved his time; ≈øo doe the things of this life, but they continue not, our health and ≈øtrength are with us in youth, but they ≈øtay not. The flowers give their ≈ømell in the ≈øpring, but by and by they are withered and gone. The Sunne gives light in the day time, but hides it ≈øelfe in the night; cloathes keep us warme, but they wear away. But God is a la≈øting, yea and an everla≈øting good; <hi>He is God and changeth not,</hi> and therefore is called, <hi>God from everla≈øting to everla≈øting, P≈øal.</hi> 90.2. In a word, he is ≈øufficient,</p>

For fir≈øt, they have nece≈ø≈øaries as well as they that have more, though but little before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.

And la≈øtly, If Gods ≈øervants want at any time, he ≈øees a little to be better for them then more abundance, not becau≈øe God cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill their nece≈ø≈øitie, or is not willing; he is able to ≈øupply their wants, and will in due time admini≈øter all Grace to them.

                  <hi>I the Lord thy redeemer lead thee in the way wherein thou ≈øhoulde≈øt goe.</hi> Hence is that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.10.12. <hi>The Lord</hi> alone <hi>led him, and there was no ≈øtrange God with him.</hi> He <hi>alone</hi> provided for them, he <hi>alone</hi> fed them, he <hi>alone</hi> conducted them, he <hi>alone</hi> did all for them.</p>
               <p>As it is thus in temporall benefits, ≈øo al≈øo in ≈øpirituall ble≈ø≈øings, the Lord is from him≈øelfe all in all unto his people. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.16.<note place="margin">Ezek. 11.16.</note> the Lord tells them, that <hi>he would carry them into captivitie,</hi> and now le≈øt they ≈øhould be di≈øcouraged for want of the Temple and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, therefore the Lord promi≈øes, that <hi>he will be a Sanctuary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them;</hi> he will ≈øupply unto them the want of publique ordinances from him≈øelfe. Hence is that in <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 54.17.<note place="margin">I≈øai. 54.17.</note> it is ≈øaid that they ≈øhall be <hi>taught of God;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> that the ≈øpirit helpes the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods people; when the ≈øervants of God would pray, but they cannot, the Spirit him≈øelfe maketh up their wants, and fills their hearts with groanes which pierce the heavens. So when they are to ≈øpeake before the adver≈øaries of Gods truth, and they know not how to an≈øwer, then the Lord puts an an≈øwer into their mouthes, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.20.</note> So al≈øo in the preaching of the Word, the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe puts words into the mouthes of his ≈øervants, that whereas they may ≈øay as <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> Exod. 4.10. <hi>I am of a ≈øtammering tongue and cannot ≈øpeake,</hi> or as <hi>Jer. cap.</hi> 1.6. <hi>I am a childe, &amp;c.</hi> yet the Lord is a mouth unto them, and they ≈øpeake words not which mans wi≈ødome teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but which the Holy Gho≈øt teacheth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.13.</note> that they which heare them are forced to ≈øay, God is in you of a truth. So al≈øo in the comfort and peace that God giveth unto his ≈øervants, he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:113533:77"/> giveth it not as the world giveth, by abundance of earthly comforts and outward pro≈øperitie, but when all things threaten trouble, yet then he gives peace from him≈øelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27.<note place="margin">Joh. 14.27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Con≈øider how God is all to his people from him≈øelfe, even in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion &amp; enjoyment of his good ble≈ø≈øings; ≈øometimes the Lord continues to us the meanes of life, and yet ≈øo workes and orders all, that the benefit and ble≈ø≈øing is evidently ≈øeene to come not from them, but from the Lord alone; And this he maketh to appeare divers wayes.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Sometimes God lets us enjoy the creature, and yet wee want the ble≈ø≈øing for a ≈øea≈øon, till he command a ble≈ø≈øing to come. Sometimes we have raine, but not the raine of ble≈ø≈øing, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he cau≈øeth it to come in mercy, and to become a ble≈ø≈øing. The Sunne ≈øhineth in the firmament, but we want the heat of it, the warmth and quickning power of it is withheld, to let us ≈øee that it is not the Sunne, but the Lord, by which we doe enjoy the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing. We ca≈øt our ≈øeed into the ground, but it doth not pro≈øper, afterward it growes and flouri≈øheth. Sometimes we carry out much, and bring in little, what is the rea≈øon? It is to let us ≈øee the truth of that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.7.</note> that <hi>it is the Lord which giveth the increa≈øe.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we carry out little, and bring in great increa≈øe, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.10.12. The rea≈øon is, it is the Lord who giveth us to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe all things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sometimes the Lord gives us the meanes by which we live, but it is in ≈øuch a ≈øtrange and unwonted manner and way, that the hand of God is as evidently ≈øeene in the giving of the meanes, as if he had upholden our life without meanes. Thus <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.12.<note place="margin">Exod. 16.12.</note> the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> had a kinde of bread in the wilderne≈ø≈øe, but it was in ≈øuch a ≈øtrange and miraculous manner, as though they had lived fortie yeares without any food. The u≈øuall way by which we have bread, is out of the earth; according to that in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 104.14.<note place="margin">P≈øal. 104.14.</note> But the bread by which God fed them, was bread from heaven, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 105.40. As if God had made heaven a garner or ≈øtore-hou≈øe, to lay up Corne for the nece≈ø≈øities of his people. So <hi>Elijah</hi> was fed with bread and fle≈øh, which are ordinary food, but the meanes by which he had them were as ≈øtrange as though he had lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. God appointed the Ravens there to feed him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:113533:78"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Sometimes God gives ≈øome meanes to his people to enjoy, but the meanes are weake and feeble and unable to worke for our good and comfort, without a ≈øpeciall ble≈ø≈øing from him≈øelfe. Here therefore the Lord comes in, and puts his own ≈øtrength to the weakne≈ø≈øe of the meanes, and makes them worke for us aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, above that which we could expect or thinke. Thus when <hi>Daniel</hi> refu≈øed to eat the Kings meat, and cho≈øe pul≈øe, thin grewel or hearbs, or ≈øuch cour≈øe ≈øtuffe, yet his countenance was better liking, then they that did eat of the Kings meat; their well liking came not from the meat, but from an extraordinary ble≈ø≈øing that came from God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Dan. 1.</note> So <hi>Gideon</hi> mu≈øt have Souldiers and weapons of warre, and yet ≈øuch a ≈ømall company, and weake furniture, that <hi>I≈ørael</hi> mu≈øt be forced to ≈øay, <hi>I have not wrought ≈øalvation for my ≈øelfe, but it is the Lord that hath done it.</hi> So it is in ≈øpirituall meanes. God ≈øometimes gives but weake meanes to a people in compari≈øon of what others doe enjoy, yet many are turned to God by their mini≈øtry. As by the ≈øound of the trumpets of Rammes hornes, the walles of <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> fell downe, ≈øo by the mini≈øtry of weake man the Lord throwes downe the ≈øtrong hold of Satans kingdome, to the end that the excellency of the power, may appeare to be of God, not of man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Againe, ≈øometimes the Lord increa≈øeth and lengthens out the little and ≈øhort provi≈øions which he makes for his people, ≈øo that by rea≈øon of the increa≈øe which it receiveth from God, it is made as ≈øufficient, as if it were an hundred or thou≈øand-fold more. Thus with the woman of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> 1 King. 17.14.<note place="margin">1 King. 17.14.</note> the Lord increa≈øed the meale in the barrell, and the oyle in the cru≈øe, that it failed not, till the day that the Lord ≈øent raine upon the earth. Thus it was al≈øo with the widow that was in debt, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.3. ≈øhee had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay withall, but a pot of oyle, yet the Lord ≈øo multiplyed it, that there wanted not oyle, till there wanted ve≈ø≈øells to receive it. The Lord ≈øometimes cau≈øeth the little provi≈øions which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for his people, ≈øo to la≈øt, that they want not meat, till they want bellyes to receive it. Thus al≈øo it was with tho≈øe five thou≈øand that our Saviour fed with a few loaves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. And ≈øo al≈øo with the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> in the Wilderne≈ø≈øe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.5. that when no ≈øupplies of cloathing could be made to them, then the Lord made that ≈øuit of apparell upon their backe, and tho≈øe ≈øhooes which were upon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:113533:78"/> their feet to continue; this was by the ble≈ø≈øing of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Sometimes the Lord giveth the ≈øame meanes to one as to another; But there is a great difference in the comfort and ble≈ø≈øing which is injoyed by the one and by the other. One hath food, ≈øo hath another, but one eates and is ≈øatisfied, as the Lord promi≈øeth that his people ≈øhall be, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.26.<note place="margin">Joel 2.26.</note> the other eates, and is not ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as he threatneth, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 4.10. One is ≈øtrengthned, and growes ≈øtrong to labour, the other is impotent and feeble. The Lord here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ≈øhewes, that the being ≈øatisfied and receiving ≈øtrength, is not from the meanes, but from the ble≈ø≈øing which he is plea≈øed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to his people from him≈øelfe. So it is al≈øo in the meanes of grace, many people enjoy the ≈øame externall meanes, the ≈øame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtry, the ≈øame exhortation and promi≈øes; ≈øome are thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and turned unto God; others remaine blind, ignorant, and carnall; the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe that as the one ≈øeekes not unto God but onely unto man, ≈øo man onely ≈øpeakes to the one, but to the other God ≈øpeakes by his own Spirit, and workes from him≈øelfe over and above that which man doth or can doe. Thus we ≈øee that both in the want, and in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the meanes, the Lord is all to his people from him≈øelfe. Now the rea≈øons why the Lord doth thus worke from him≈øelfe are; Fir≈øt, for the glorifying of him≈øelfe. Secondly, for the comfort of his people.</p>
               <p>For the glorifying of him≈øelfe, to make his goodne≈ø≈øe and ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rea≈øon </seg>1</label> the more to appeare to his people, that they may know that he is not as man, tyed to meanes, or to the greatne≈ø≈øe and power of them, but he is an all-≈øufficient God; and therefore ≈øhould give him all the prai≈øe; and for this very end doth the Lord ≈øometimes bring his ≈øervants into ≈øtraits, beyond the helpe of any creature, that when they are brought forth, it might appeare that it is the hand of the Lord that hath done it. When as the Lord either puts us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the meanes, or cuts them ≈øhort, he doth in effect thus ≈øay to us, I have hitherto wrought for you, but it hath been by ≈øuch and ≈øuch meanes, which have been as a vaile between me and you, that you have not ≈øeene my power and goodne≈ø≈øe towards you ≈øo clearely, but now I will ≈øhew my ≈øelfe more fully to you. Now I will take away tho≈øe things which though you counted helps to your ≈øelves, yet are hindrances to hinder me, that I cannot ≈øhew my ≈øelfe ≈øo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to you. I will now therefore lay them a≈øide, and by my
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:113533:79"/> ≈øelfe, I will work for your good. The Lord herein deales with his ≈øervants, as <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> did with his brethren. While≈øt he walked more ≈øtrangely towards them, and ≈øpake to them by an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ≈øo long he ≈øuffered his ≈øervants, and as many as would, to bee pre≈øent, he cared not how many were ≈øtanding by; but when hee meant to let them know that he was <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> their brother, when hee would open all his heart to them, and let them ≈øee his abundant love, then ≈øaith <hi>Jo≈øeph, Cau≈øe every man to goe out from me, Gen.</hi> 45.1. So it is here, whiles the Lord comes to us, by ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward and ordinary means, he conver≈øeth with us but ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ≈øtrangely, ≈øpeaking as by ≈øo many Interpreters, by them to interpret his mind and will to us; but when hee will ≈øhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe to us more fami iarly, then he bids away unto all the≈øe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer means, ≈øilver, gold, and corn, &amp;c. and when all the≈øe are ≈øet a≈øide, then he comes and ≈øayes plainly, Now you ≈øhall ≈øee what I my ≈øelfe will doe for you; and that I, who am the Lord all-≈øuffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And when the Lords people ≈øee this, thereby they know him better, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him more, thereby are they forced to ≈øay, as <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 148.13.<note place="margin">P≈øal. 148.13.</note> 
                  <hi>His Name onely is excellent, his Name onely is worthy to bee exalted.</hi> Before they were ready to a≈øcribe ≈øome excellency to the means and in≈øtruments, ≈øacrificing to their own nets: but when <hi>they</hi> come to nothing, and the <hi>Lord</hi> hath by <hi>him≈øelfe</hi> fulfilled our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire, then are we lifted up to glorifie him, hee alone is ≈øeen to be an all ≈øufficient God unto his people. So that if wee ask, Why is the Lord alone in doing good to his people, and there is none with him, as <hi>David</hi> was asked, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 21.1.</note> The an≈øwer is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe <hi>I will not give my glory to another,</hi> ≈øaith God, but will have my whole glory to my ≈øelfe alone: He is alone, that he alone may be glorified.</p>

                  </label> he frames them unto a willing and voluntary ≈øubjection unto him, that they de≈øire nothing more then to be under his government, they count this their felicity, that they have the Lord over them, to governe them. As the ≈øervants of <hi>Solomon</hi> were counted happie that they might ≈øtand before him, and mini≈øter unto him; ≈øo it is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of Gods people, that they are under him, and in ≈øubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: The Lords government is not a <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like tyranny, to rule them with rigour, and make them ≈øigh and groane, but it is a government of peace; he rules them by love, as he fir≈øt winnes them by love. He conquers them indeed by a mighty ≈øtrong hand, but withall he drawes them by the cords of love. He overcometh our evill with the abundance of his goodne≈ø≈øe; therefore his ≈øpirit, though ≈øometime it be called a ≈øpirit of power, yet it is al≈øo a ≈øpirit of love, joy, and peace; though the ≈øpirit put forth his power in vanqui≈øhing our <hi>enemies</hi> that held us in bondage, yet it overcometh <hi>us</hi> by love, making us to ≈øee what a ble≈ø≈øed thing it is to have the Lord to be over us. Thus when the Lord is in Covenant with a people, they follow him not forcedly, but as farre as they are ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by grace, they ≈øubmit willingly to his regiment. Therefore tho≈øe that can be drawne to nothing that is good, but by compul≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and con≈øtraint, it is a ≈øigne that they are not under the gracious government of the Lord God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If God be God over us, governing us by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his grace, wee mu≈øt yeeld him univer≈øall obedience in all things. He mu≈øt not be over us in one thing, and under us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he mu≈øt be over us in every thing; Gods authoritie is ca≈øt away by refu≈øing obedience to one Commandement, as well as by
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:113533:85"/> refu≈øing obedience unto all. His authoritie is ≈øeene in one, as well as in another. And he that breaketh one, doth in effect breake all, as <hi>James</hi> 2.11.<note place="margin">James 2.11.</note> When God cometh to rule, he cometh with power, to ca≈øt downe every ≈øtrong hold, and every high thought that is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again≈øt the power of Chri≈øt. He cometh to lay wa≈øte the whole kingdome of ≈øinne, all mu≈øt downe, not a ≈øtone left of that <hi>Babel.</hi> The Lord will reigne in the whole ≈øoule, he will have no God, no King with him. And therefore herein looke unto it, if he be God over us, he alone mu≈øt rule over us, and no other with him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider whether Gods dominion hath its full extent in us; whether there be not ≈øome corruption which thou de≈øire≈øt to be ≈øpared in: Can≈øt thou give up thy ≈øelfe wholly to the power of grace, to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by it? Can≈øt thou part with thy <hi>Ab≈øalom,</hi> thy beloved lu≈øt, and be content that God ≈øhould ≈øet up his kingdome in thy whole ≈øoule? Then is God over thee, and thou in Covenant with him. But if thou can≈øt not ≈øubmit that the life of ≈øome darling lu≈øt ≈øhould goe; if there be any ≈øinne that is dearer to thee, then to obey God; if thou ha≈øt thy exceptions, and re≈øervations, and wilt not yeeld univer≈øall obedience, then art thou an alien from God and his Covenant; God is no God unto thee, nor art thou one of his people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Where the Lord governeth and ≈øetteth up his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome over the ≈øoule, he carries and lifts up the heart to an higher pitch, and above that which fle≈øh and bloud could or would attaine unto. And that both in the things them≈øelves, and the ends which they ayme at in them. He makes a man undertake ≈øuch things as his owne heart would refu≈øe and turne from; as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.14.<note place="margin">Ezek. 3.14.</note> he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry backward to preach to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and yet when he ≈øaw it was the Lords minde he ≈øubmitted. So <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> 15.20.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.20.</note>) <hi>enforced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe</hi> to preach the Go≈øpel, yet it was not a con≈øtrained force, but the love of Chri≈øt con≈øtrained him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> So <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> though at the fir≈øt very loath to goe to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> yet when the power of grace prevailed in him, he contends with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as with his equall in the cau≈øe of God, and would not yeeld to the fiercenes of the King, not for an hoofe; ≈øo though he fled from the ≈øerpent at the fir≈øt fight, yet at Gods commandement he taketh it up in his hand. This al≈øo wee ≈øee in <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was commanded to ≈øacrifice his owne ≈øonne, though he loved him, yet he loved God more, and therefore obeyed, which nature alone could never have done. In all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:113533:85"/> the≈øe they wrought again≈øt the ≈øtreame, doing that which fle≈øh and bloud could never have done. Againe, the power of Gods Grace in his government lifts up the ≈øoule to higher ends and aymes, then fle≈øh and bloud can attaine unto. The kingdome of Gods grace, is called the kingdome of heaven, his aymes and ends are on high, not earthly but heavenly, his government is an heavenly regiment, the Lord governeth the hearts of his people to the ≈øame end which he hath propounded to him≈øelfe. Gods ends and our ends meet in one, which is the glorifying of his Name. This putteth the difference between all formall hypocrites, and tho≈øe that are ruled by the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace: hypocrites are ruled by their owne ≈øpirit, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ayme at higher then their owne ends, their owne honour, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, profit, &amp;c. Though their actions may be ≈øpirituall, yet their ends are carnall; but when God taketh the heart into his guidance, then he maketh us to ≈øet up him as highe≈øt in the throne, and all is done for his honour. It makes a man to u≈øe and imploy him≈øelfe, wi≈ødome, ≈øtrength, riches, credit, and e≈øteeme in the Church, and all for God, not for him≈øelfe; God is his la≈øt end in every thing, as mo≈øt worthy to be glorified by all. Indeed a man in Covenant with God may doe many things for him≈øelfe, ayming at the furtherance of his owne good both ≈øpirituall and temporall, and al≈øo ayme at the good of other men, but this is not in oppo≈øition, but in ≈øubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to God and his glory; that la≈øt and maine end mu≈øt ≈øway all other ends. Nothing mu≈øt be done to cro≈ø≈øe and hinder his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this is the government of Gods Grace. Con≈øider how Gods ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit guides thy heart to tho≈øe things, and aymes, that fle≈øh and bloud cannot at all reach unto; for if thou ha≈øt onely thine own end and ayme, then thou art thine owne, and not under the government of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Covenant of Gods grace cau≈øeth the peace of God to lodge in that ≈øoule in which it ruleth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The kingdome of God is righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho≈øt.</hi> Grace and peace goe hand in hand; There is a raigne and rule of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.21.</note> And ≈øo there is of peace, <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 3.15.<note place="margin">Colo≈ø. 3.15.</note> As under the raigne of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> there was abundance of peace, ≈øo there is under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chri≈øt, he is the King of <hi>Salem.</hi> And the more the ≈øoule is ≈øubjected unto his government, the more peace it finds. And that may be ≈øeene in the≈øe two things.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:113533:86"/>
               <p>Fir≈øt, In the di≈øpen≈øations and admini≈øtrations of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though things goe cro≈ø≈øe again≈øt us, we meet with many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Gods providences ≈øeeme to cro≈ø≈øe his promi≈øes, yet there is peace to the ≈øoule in it; therefore ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. la≈øt. <hi>In the world you ≈øhall have trouble, but in mee you ≈øhall have peace.</hi> Certain it is, that if ever our hearts be out of quiet, it is becau≈øe there is ≈øome ≈øedition and trayterous con≈øpiracy, which hath been ri≈øing up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the kingdome of Chri≈øt, and this workes trouble; but where the ≈øoule is ≈øubjected to the regiment of grace, it maketh it to re≈øt in peace; In all wrongs, injuries, and cro≈ø≈øes, it knowes the Lord will right them; In all wants, it knowes that he will provide; In all kind of tryalls, that he will with the temptation give an i≈ø≈øue in due time. But the heart that is un≈øubdued to Gods kingdome, is ready to fret again≈øt God, and ≈øit downe di≈øcontented when any thing cro≈ø≈øeth him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As it re≈øteth in peace under the di≈øpen≈øations of Gods providences, ≈øo it re≈øts in peace in regard of the ≈øpirituall enemies of our ≈øalvation, which fight again≈øt our ≈øoules. What≈øoever threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens our ruine, the ≈øoule ≈øhrowds it ≈øelfe under the wing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, and concludes with the Prophet, <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 33.22. <hi>The Lord is my Judge, he is my King, and he will ≈øave me.</hi> Let us examine our ≈øelves by the≈øe things, and we may ≈øee whether we be under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God, and ≈øo whether we be in Covenant with him.</p>

               <p>This being one of the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant of Grace, to have <label type="milestone">

Againe, it is grace, becau≈øe we have nothing to ≈øatisfie withall for the evills which wee have done, and therefore there is the more grace to us in pardoning. Againe, there is grace in it, becau≈øe God hath power in his hand to take vengeance; He doth not pa≈ø≈øe by ≈øin, as men doe offences, when they di≈ø≈øemble forgivenes, becau≈øe they cannot tell how to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and yet carry rancor and malice in their hearts, but God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives, though he hath power to de≈øtroy and take vengeance, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35.<note place="margin">Deut. 32.35.</note> He is able to de≈øtroy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> and yet choo≈øeth to forgive.

               <p>Fir≈øt, con≈øider the nature of ≈øin, which is a kind of wrong do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, there is injurious provocation in it, provoking the jealou≈øie of the mighty God. As if a wi≈øe ≈øhould wrong her husband by for≈øaking him, and joyning her ≈øelf to another man, how could ≈øuch a wrong be recompenced? Yet ≈øuch wrong we doe unto God: for in every ≈øin wee commit, there is a turning unto the creature, and for≈øaking the Creator.

               <p>Secondly, con≈øider again≈øt whom our ≈øins have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that will ≈øet forth grace more: They are not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again≈øt man alone, but again≈øt the Lord.

               <p>Thirdly, con≈øider to whom ≈øin is forgiven, and to whom it is not forgiven: it is forgiven to us that were enemies, but not to his own deare Sonne when hee came to be a mediator between God and us.

               <p>Fourthly, con≈øider the quality of the Lords forgivene≈ø≈øe both in the freene≈ø≈øe and fulne≈ø≈øe of it: he forgiveth freely, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24.25.</note>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:113533:89"/> the eye of his knowledge, yet he doth not ≈øee them by the eye of his judgement, to lay them to their charge.

               <p>Secondly, as there is grace ≈øhewn from God in the pardon of ≈øinne, ≈øo infinite benefit and ble≈ø≈øing commeth to us thereby, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed is the man who≈øe iniquity is forgiven, &amp;c.</hi> This is not a promi≈øe of no value, but is one of the mo≈øt great and pretious promi≈øes of the Covenant, of more worth then thou≈øands of gold and ≈øilver. How great a benefit this is, will appeare, if we con≈øider how great an evill ≈øinne is which by forgivene≈ø≈øe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. The greatne≈ø≈øe of the one will ≈øet forth the greatne≈ø≈øe of the other. Now ≈øin is the greate≈øt evill in the world, and that both in it ≈øelfe, and to us.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, in it ≈øelfe it is the greate≈øt, whether we con≈øider it ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in its own nature and being; or cau≈øally, making evill the ≈øubject that it dwels in. In the former re≈øpect it is the greate≈øt evill, becau≈øe it is contrary to the greate≈øt good. God is good, he is goodne≈ø≈øe it ≈øelfe, his will al≈øo is holy, ju≈øt, and good. Now nothing is ≈øo contrary to God, and to the goodne≈ø≈øe of his holy will, as ≈øin is: this cro≈ø≈øeth the holine≈ø≈øe of his will. And as for the other, if we con≈øider fin cau≈øally, what is it which makes the creature evill (as we read of evill Angels, <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 78.49.<note place="margin">P≈øal. 78.49.</note> and of evill men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.13.</note>) Whence is it that they are become evill?

               <p>Fir≈øt, becau≈øe it is ≈øin, and ≈øin onely, which excludes us from God, and makes a ≈øeparation between God and us.

Now by the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of ≈øin we return again unto our former e≈øtate in which wee ≈øtood before our fall, before that ≈øin had broken us off from God. Now as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>We have fellow≈øhip with the Father, and with his Sonne Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> In our fall ≈øin brake off our communion with God, but by the forgivene≈ø≈øe of ≈øin wee have liberty to recover this our communion with him again.</p>

See <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 43.25. And this the Lord will doe:</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, becau≈øe mercy plea≈øeth him, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. It is a plea≈øure to him to ≈øhew mercy to his covenanted people. Never did we take more plea≈øure (nor ≈øo much) in the acting and committing of our ≈øins, as he doth in the pardoning of them. Hee is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> And therefore delights in mercy, as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delighteth in his children. It doth him good to ≈øee the fruit of his own mercy in the taking away of the ≈øins of his people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is the purpo≈øe which he hath everla≈øtingly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed within him≈øelfe, to make his grace glorious in tho≈øe whom he hath by covenant given unto Chri≈øt to be ≈øaved by him; he <hi>will have</hi> the prai≈øe of <hi>the glory</hi> of his grace, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 1.6.<note place="margin">Ephe≈ø. 1 6.</note> Hee will not lo≈øe this glory, he will be admired in the Saints, 2 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 1.10.<note place="margin">2 The≈ø≈ø 1.10.</note> Hee will make the world to wonder, when it ≈øhall bee known what ≈øin hath been committed by them, and pardoned by him.

               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:113533:91"/>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord hath received a ≈øatisfaction to his Ju≈øtice in Chri≈øt; what ever Ju≈øtice could require at our hand, Chri≈øt hath ≈øatisfied for us to the utmo≈øt farthing. So that now Ju≈øtice cannot complaine, though that ≈øin be forgiven unto us, becau≈øe it was fully puni≈øhed in Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If the Lord ≈øhould not forgive the ≈øinnes of his people which believe on Chri≈øt, Chri≈øt his ≈øufferings ≈øhould be in vaine. To what end was it for him to ≈øuffer, the ju≈øt for the unju≈øt? Why was the cha≈øti≈øement of our peace laid upon him, if wee ≈øhould al≈øo ≈øuffer for our owne ≈øinnes? God would never have laid our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon him, but that he intended to forgive them unto us.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is no other way to have ≈øinne done away, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to get free from ≈øin, but by forgivenes. Either God mu≈øt forgive ≈øin, or all the world mu≈øt be condemned, and lie under his cur≈øe for ever. But there are a remnant, that God will ≈øave from peri≈øhing in the condemnation of the world, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Lord hath not onely promi≈øed forgivenes, and ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it with his mouth, but his act and deed gives us a≈ø≈øurance that he will faithfully performe unto us that which he hath promi≈øed, his dealing with us doth evidently declare his gracious inclination towards us, and his readine≈ø≈øe to forgive.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, His great patience in waiting for our repentance and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, he waits for this very end, that he might be gracious, <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 30.18.<note place="margin">I≈øai. 30.18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, His proclaiming of his Name, as he doth in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>The Lord, the Lord, gracious, mercifull, forgiving iniquities;</hi> why doth the Lord thus proclaime his Name, and tell us openly that he is a <hi>God forgiving iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. but that we might take notice of his graciou≈øne≈ø≈øe towards us, and might be encouraged to looke unto him for forgivene≈ø≈øe? Even as Kings proclaime their pardon, that they might be acknowledged to be gracious Lords.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His gracious invitation al≈øo a≈ø≈øures us that he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; <hi>Come unto me,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. If ≈øin burthen you, I will ea≈øe you. Yea he entreats us to accept of reconciliation, and to be reconciled unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Con≈øider his commanding of us to forgive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he commands other men to forgive us, which is an argument that him≈øelfe will forgive. For, fir≈øt, herein he ≈øhewes his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:113533:91"/> us, that he would not have the hatred of any creature to lye again≈øt us, no not ≈øo much as the di≈øplea≈øure of a weake man; but would have us to enjoy their love; how much le≈ø≈øe then will he let his owne wrath lye upon us, which is infinitely more heavie then the di≈øplea≈øure of all the creatures in the whole world? and ≈øecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If he would have <hi>us</hi> to forgive one another, which have ≈øo littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This lets us ≈øee the onely way to get free from the guilt of our <label type="milestone">

Others thinke to make amends for their ≈øinnes, that they will appea≈øe God with thou≈øands of Rammes, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand rivers of oyle, as <hi>Micah</hi> 6.7. but the Lord will be appea≈øed by none of the≈øe. Our onely way is to fly to grace, and to free forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, all other meanes, whether pardons from men, or ≈øatisfactions from our ≈øelves, will not free us from the guilt of the lea≈øt ≈øin, the taking away of our ≈øinnes mu≈øt either be by free forgivene≈ø≈øe, or they mu≈øt lye upon us for ever.</p>
               <p>Is forgivene≈ø≈øe of ≈øinnes one of the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant? then <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Con≈øider the loath≈øomenes of the ≈øin and corruption which we have brought upon our ≈øelves, and doth now lie upon us; <hi>A wicked man is loath≈øome</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Solomon) Pro.</hi> 13.5.<note place="margin">Prov. 13.5.</note> So loath≈øome is the ≈øin that is in us, that we are made even to loath our ≈øelves, and to count our ≈øelves more filthy then the dung of the earth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. When the Lord formed man in the beginning, it was not ≈øilver or gold, or any ≈øuch precious matter, out of which he fa≈øhioned him, but it was out of the vile≈øt of the Elements, out of the earth, the dregs &amp; ≈øetlings of all creatures. The matter out of which man was
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:113533:99"/> then made, was but vile and ba≈øe. Wonder it was that God would ≈øet the gracious Image of his holines upon ≈øo contemptible a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But though it was then but vile, yet it was (as I may ≈øo ≈øpeake) innocent, harmles. The pollution of ≈øinne had not as yet defiled it, there was nothing in it as yet, which ≈øhould make the holy God to loath the creature which he had made; ≈øinne had not as yet ≈øtained the earth with its filthines. But now by ≈øin man is become abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his uncleanne≈ø≈øe is as the filthines of the men≈øtruous; the filthy lepro≈øie of ≈øin is not in his forehead alone, but is ≈øpread all over him; ≈øo that the Lord might ≈øay unto him, Depart, depart yee polluted, ≈øtand apart, the pure eyes of my holines cannot endure to behold ≈øuch loath≈øome filthines. But now behold and wonder, even the God ≈øo glorious in holines, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. even he ≈øeeing us lye polluted in our bloud, he doth not pa≈ø≈øe by on the other ≈øide, but he takes pitie on us, and takes us and wa≈øheth us with water; he wa≈øheth us from our bloud, and anoynteth us with oyle, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6.9. yea and cloaths us againe with white linnen of ≈øanctity and holines, adornes us with ornaments of grace, which are as jewels of ≈øilver and jewels of gold, &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. and makes us beautifull by his owne beauty which he puts upon us. And is not this grace? Had wee ≈øeene our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour ri≈øe up from the table to wa≈øh the foule feet of his ≈øervants, we would have wondred. How much more wonderfull is this, that he ≈øhould take us filthy lepers, and wa≈øh us in the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> untill we be wholly cleane? Con≈øider that place in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9. how the Lord him≈øelfe amplifies this grace towards us in wa≈øhing us from our polluted bloud. No le≈ø≈øe then three times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Lord there mention this, <hi>When I ≈øaw thee polluted in thy bloud;</hi> (≈øaith the Lord) and againe, <hi>When thou wa≈øt in thy bloud;</hi> and a third time, <hi>Even when thou wa≈øt in thy bloud, then I took thee and wa≈øhed thee, and ≈øaid unto thee, Thou ≈øhalt live.</hi> Why doth the Lord ≈øo ingeminate, ≈øo double and treble this, <hi>When thou wa≈øt in thy bloud?</hi> but onely that we might the more ob≈øerve his abundant grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in purifying ≈øuch loath≈øome uncleane ones as wee are.

               <p>Thirdly, Con≈øider how unable we are to clean≈øe and purifie our ≈øelves; we are like little babes, who can defile them≈øelves, but would
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:113533:100"/> lie in their uncleannes for ever, ≈øhould not the nur≈øe wa≈øh &amp; clean≈øe them; we once ≈øtript our ≈øelves of the garments of grace, but now we know not how to put them on any more; we were <hi>men,</hi> at that time, when (in <hi>Adam</hi>) wee laid them by and put them off: But now like little <hi>children</hi> we ≈øhould ≈øtarve with cold and nakedne≈ø≈øe, ≈øhould not the Lord pitie us, and put the≈øe garments of grace upon us. <hi>We are,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>of no ≈øtrength,</hi> Rom. 5.6.<note place="margin">Rom 5.6.</note> not able to thinke a good thought,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> nor to will one good de≈øire; but it is God that worketh in us both will and deed of his good plea≈øure of grace towards us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> It is not in our willing or running, but in God ≈øhewing mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.16.</note> And it is not unworthy our ob≈øerving, how in <hi>ver.</hi> 18. he oppo≈øeth mercy to hardening, <hi>(He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth)</hi> to teach us to look at it as a ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall mercy, when he is plea≈øed to take away the hard &amp; ≈øtony heart from us, and give us an heart of fle≈øh, ≈øoft and pliable to his will.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As we could not renew &amp; ≈øanctifie our ≈øelves, ≈øo neither could any other help us, and re≈øtore us againe to the holines we had lo≈øt; In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5.<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.5.</note> the Lord tells his people there, how little helpe they had from any other, when they lay in their mi≈øery, there was no eye that pitied them, to doe any thing to them, or to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øion on them. The Prie≈øt and the Levite, they come and look on, but they pa≈ø≈øe by on the other ≈øide, there is nothing done to heale the wound which Satan by ≈øin had given to our ≈øoules, but they are let alone to putrifie and corrupt the whole man more and more, ≈øo as from the crowne of the head to the ≈øole of the foot, there is nothing but ≈øores, and ≈øwelling, and wounds full of corruption, <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 1. But when the Lord ≈øaw that there was none to helpe, then he him≈øelfe (like the good <hi>Samaritan</hi>) comes &amp; wa≈øheth our wounds, powring in wine and oyle, to clean≈øe and to heale us. Such was our pollution, ≈øo deeply ≈øet, that all the water of the Sea, all the bloud of bulls and goats, could not clean≈øe us; yea though we ≈øhould wa≈øh in <hi>Nitre</hi> and take us much ≈øope, yet our iniquity would ≈øtill ≈øtand undone away before the face of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.22. Onely that ≈øpirit of life, that ≈øpirit of holines, that ≈øpirit of power which is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, that ≈øpirit being ≈øhed down upon us, that clean≈øeth us, wa≈øheth us, ≈øanctifies us; without this, all helps under heaven had been in vaine, without this ≈øpirit, neither Word, Sacrament, Commandements, promi≈øes, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trained up in the Communion of the Church, and Chri≈øtian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:113533:100"/> neither any nor all the≈øe could availe to renew us to the grace from which we are fallen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, Let me adde this one thing more, If we ≈øhould look at God him≈øelfe onely as ju≈øt, and not as gracious, we could never have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to have obtained this ble≈ø≈øing from him. Ju≈øtice could have ≈øaid no other unto us, then as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.39. Seeing you would not obey me, goe therefore &amp; ≈øerve every man his Idoll, ≈øerve your ≈øin. When we had turned the glory of God into a lye, and had wor≈øhipped the creature above the Creator, (who is ble≈ø≈øed for ever) Ju≈øtice would then have given us up unto vile affections, and to our owne hearts lu≈øts, and to a reprobate mind, to doe the things that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, ≈øo receiving in our ≈øelves ≈øuch a recompence of our errour as was meet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> This would have been the reward of Ju≈øtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us for our ≈øin; But here Grace comes in and powres downe upon us a ≈øpirit of grace and of ≈øanctification, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> to wa≈øh us from our uncleannes, that we might be an holy people unto God. And hence it is that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. when the Apo≈øtle prayes for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of our ≈øanctification in us, he looks at God as a God of all Grace; <hi>The God of all Grace</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>which hath called us unto his eternall glory by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, confirme, ≈øtrengthen, and ≈øtabli≈øh you, &amp;c.</hi> As thereby ≈øhewing from what fountain the benefit of ≈øanctification comes, namely, from Grace, from the God of all grace. He is a God of all grace towards us in ≈øanctifying of us.</p>
               <p>This may helpe to ≈øettle us and confirme us in the truth, namely, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">∆≤≈øe </seg>1</label> that ≈øeeing Sanctification is a ble≈ø≈øing of the Covenant of grace, even as forgivenes is, therefore it is a warrantable and ≈øafe way for a man by and from his ≈øanctification to take an evidence of his ju≈øtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of his e≈øtate in Grace before God.

                  </label> Some have not doubted to affirme as much, but fal≈øely, and the fal≈øity of this opinion may be made evident by the≈øe Con≈øiderations following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This opinion imports thus much, That one under the covenant of workes, may performe acts that are holy, which is fal≈øe; he may indeed doe ≈øuch things as are materially holy, as being commanded of God, who≈øe word and Covenant doth ≈øanctifie them, &amp; make the things holy in them≈øelves, but they are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally holy, but, (coming from their impure hearts) thereby they are polluted and defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. And therefore can have no ≈øuch power to worke ≈øanctitie in the ≈øubject whence they come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If true ≈øanctification may be in one that is under the Covenant of workes, then mu≈øt we of nece≈ø≈øity change the articles or promi≈øes of the Covenant of Grace, &amp; make the promi≈øe of ≈øanctification no part of it; we mu≈øt blot out tho≈øe promi≈øes of <hi>writing the law in our hearts,</hi> and <hi>putting a new ≈øpirit within us,</hi> and all other promi≈øes of the like nature, mu≈øt be ra≈øed out of the covenant of grace, if one under the Covenant of workes may attaine to this ≈øanctification by his owne workes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This opinion is directly cro≈ø≈øe and contrary to the Apo≈øtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. where he tells us, that we receive the ≈øpirit of Sanctification, not by the workes of the law, but by hearing of faith preached. It is the doctrine of grace, not of workes, which makes us partakers of this ≈øpirit. And hence it is that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. he tells us, that it is the new Te≈øtament which is the mini≈øtration of the Spirit, by which the Spirit is mini≈øtred and conveyed uto us. The law, or the workes of the law doe not.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>Concerning the≈øe ≈øeverall works of the three Per≈øons, we are to con≈øider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are all of equall extent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they doe all i≈ø≈øue from the ≈øame ≈øpring and fountaine of Grace.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, they are of the ≈øame extent, none larger nor narrower then another: Tho≈øe that the Father hath cho≈øen, tho≈øe doth the Sonne redeem; Tho≈øe that the Sonne hath redeemed, tho≈øe doth the Spirit ≈øanctifie. The Father choo≈øeth none, but whom hee gives to the Sonne to be redeemed by him; the Sonne redeems none but tho≈øe that were ≈øo given him by the Father; and ≈øo it holds al≈øo in the third place, that the Holy Gho≈øt ≈øanctifies none but whom the Father had cho≈øen, and the Sonne redeemed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it is thus in the extent, ≈øo it is al≈øo in re≈øpect of the ground and cau≈øe from which they i≈ø≈øue and ≈øpring: Look then, as our Election is of Grace and not of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. and our Redemption is of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. ≈øo is our Sanctification al≈øo, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. Not according to the works which we had done, but according to his mercy he ≈øaved us, by the wa≈øhing of the new birth, and the renewing of the Holy Gho≈øt: ≈øo that the ≈øame grace, favour, and good will which moved the Father to ≈øet his love upon us in our Election, and cau≈øed the Sonne to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe for our Redemption, the ≈øame Grace ≈øends or brings the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into our hearts to renew us unto holine≈ø≈øe. And thence it is, that ≈øometimes we are ≈øaid to be cho≈øen that we might be holy, as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. ≈øometimes ≈øaid to be redeemed that we might be holy, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. to the end that we might know that our ≈øanctification and renewing unto holine≈ø≈øe doth come from the ≈øame grace, as doe our election and redemption; and therefore as our election is not of works, but of grace; and our redemption is not of works, but of grace; ≈øo it is al≈øo concerning our ≈øanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I conclude therefore that by the works of the Law, no man being under the Law or Covenant of works, can attaine to true ≈øanctification and holine≈ø≈øe. And if ≈øanctification be not by the Law or Covenant of works, then it nece≈ø≈øarily and invincibly followes, that for a man to try his e≈øtate in Grace by his ≈øanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is no turning a≈øide to a Covenant of works.</p>
               <p>Thus much we do not unwillingly a≈ø≈øent unto, namely that there
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:113533:103"/> is a kinde of outward ≈øanctification (improperly ≈øo called) or rather an outward reformation, which a man under the Covenant of Works may attayn unto. The Law hath a power not only to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate and provoke the lu≈øt that is within, by its contrariety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. but al≈øo to curb and re≈øtrayn the breaking of it forth into outward acts, by the terrour of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. And by this reformation thus wrought by the work of re≈øtraynt, the unclean Spirit may ≈øeem to be ca≈øt forth, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever reformation is thus wrought, is as farre from true ≈øanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as earth is from heaven: For though this reformation doth and may come from ≈øome inward work of the Spirit of God upon the ≈øpirit and ≈øoule of man, as namely to convince and terrifie the con≈øcience, to ≈øtirre the affections, and to awe the will al≈øo, ≈øo that a man dares not commit the things he would, yet the minde and will is ≈øtill unrenewed, the frame and di≈øpo≈øition of the heart is ≈øtill the ≈øame as it was before; and therefore this reformation is not true ≈øanctification. <hi>That</hi> may be by the Law, <hi>this</hi> is only by the Go≈øpel and from Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.29. it is ≈øaid of ≈øome, who in re≈øpect of their inward e≈øtate never went beyond a Covenant of works; yet of them it is ≈øaid that they were ≈øanctified by the blood of the Covenant, which is the blood of Chri≈øt; therefore ≈øuch as are under a Covenant of works may be ≈øanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> There is a twofold ≈øanctification, one reall, another in profe≈ø≈øion only. As ≈øome men are ≈øaid to beleeve when the work of faith is really wrought in the heart, who are therefore ≈øaid to be found in the faith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.13. and 2.2. ≈øo others are ≈øaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, only becau≈øe they make a profe≈ø≈øion of faith, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. <hi>Simon</hi> him≈øelfe beleeved al≈øo &amp;c. i.e. he profe≈ø≈øed to beleeve.

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. 3 There is a ≈øanctification to men, making us ≈øo to be e≈øteemed by men; and there is al≈øo a ≈øanctification to God, when we are ≈øo indeed in the ≈øight of God. Now this ≈øanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here ≈øpoken of was in profe≈ø≈øion, externall, in re≈øpect of men, and in e≈øteem of men, but not reall, inward, and in re≈øpect of God, ≈øo as to make them holy and blamele≈ø≈øe in his ≈øight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But they had reall gifts, as illumination, ≈øome delight in the word, and ≈øuch like, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. therefore they were really ≈øanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It followeth not, becau≈øe there may be ≈øome reall work wrought in the ≈øoule, which yet may not reach ≈øo farre as to reall and true ≈øanctification. There may be ≈øome morall di≈øpo≈øitions wrought in a man, which are reall in their kinde, and yet may come farre ≈øhort of true ≈øanctification. <hi>Object.</hi> As where there is the ≈øub≈øtance and being of a man, there is a true man; ≈øo where there is ≈øuch a being of reall gifts, there mu≈øt needs be reall and true ≈øanctification. <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Where there is the ≈øub≈øtance of a man there is a true man, if <hi>true</hi> be taken for <hi>verum naturale,</hi> which hath a true naturall exi≈øtence and being, and is not a meere <hi>≈øpectrum,</hi> a phanta≈øm, an image or ≈øhadow of a thing. And thus taking <hi>true</hi> in this ≈øence, a rank theef is a true man. But take <hi>true</hi> for <hi>verum morale,</hi> for that morall truth which is required in the word, then may there be the ≈øub≈øtance of a man, head, armes, feet, &amp;c. and yet this man may not bee a true man con≈øidered thus morally: bring this man to the rule of the word, try his actions by the truth which the word requires, and then he which was found a true man in the former con≈øideration, will here be found a man fal≈øe and deceitfull. So here, gifts may be really wrought in a man by a phy≈øicall work of the ≈øpirit, and yet bring the≈øe ≈øame gifts and the actions produced by them to the rule of the word, and try whether they will an≈øwer to the patterne of true ≈øanctification which the word layes down, and then their ≈øanctification will be found fal≈øe, comming ≈øhort of that holine≈ø≈øe of truth which is in the true Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the≈øe here mentioned are ≈øaid to be ≈øanctified by the blood of the Covenant, that is the blood of Chri≈øt; but the blood of Chri≈øt doth not ≈øanctify only outwardly, as touching the purifying of the fle≈øh; but it purgeth the con≈øcience al≈øo within,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:113533:104"/> to ≈øerve the living God; and therefore the≈øe here mentioned were inwardly and truly ≈øanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The blood of Chri≈øt is taken either Properly, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally: Properly, as in 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. where he ≈øaith, <hi>the blood of Je≈øus Chri≈øt his Sonne clen≈øeth us from all ≈øinne:</hi> the blood in the ≈øpirituall efficacy of it being applyed unto us, doth indeed inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clen≈øe us from all ≈øinne. But ≈øometimes the blood of Chri≈øt is taken Sacramentally, and it is received Sacramentally only; and thus the Water in Bapti≈øm, and the Wine in the Supper, is the blood of Chri≈øt, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and 11. Now this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall blood was ≈øprinkled upon them, they were wa≈øhed with the Sacramentall blood of Chri≈øt in Bapti≈øm; but the ≈øpirituall efficacy of the blood it ≈øelfe never touched their con≈øcience, though the ≈øign of it might be ≈øprinkled on the outward man. And thus <hi>Paraeus, Erat eorum ≈øanctificatio non interna ≈øed externa, in profe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one fidei &amp; participatione ≈øacramentorum extern√¢ con≈øi≈øtens.</hi> They were ≈øanctified, that is, (≈øayth he) they were by profe≈ø≈øion ≈øegre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from the Iewes and Pagans, and were accounted for true Chri≈øtians or for Saints. To conclude, the an≈øwer to the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, the allu≈øion is to that of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.3. to 9. where <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> makes up the Covenant betwixt God and the people: there <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> fir≈øt rehear≈øeth unto them the words of the Covenant, to which they ≈øhew them≈øelves willing to a≈ø≈øent, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 3; then having taken order for the killing of the Sacrifice, the blood whereof was to ratify and confirm the Covenant, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 4, 5. next he takes part of the blood and ≈øprinkles it upon the people, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 8. u≈øing the≈øe words, <hi>behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you, concerning all the≈øe things.</hi> And now the people having thus farre accepted the terms and conditions of the Covenant, and accepted the blood of the Covenant, being willing to be ≈øprinkled with it: now (I ≈øay) this people was a ≈øanctified and holy people, a people in Covenant with God, ≈øeparated from the prophane peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the world, and were now e≈øteemed a peculiar and holy people, though yet many of them were not inwardly ≈øanctified, but only thus farre in re≈øpect of externall confederation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion; ≈øo it is with the≈øe here ≈øpoken of, they were content to accept the ≈øprinkling of the ≈øacramentall blood upon them, and outwardly profe≈ø≈øed them≈øelves willing (as <hi>I≈ørael</hi> did) to become
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:113533:105"/> the people of God; but yet all this while they were never in truth inwardly ≈øanctified, never wa≈øhed with the wa≈øhing of the new birth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. This allu≈øion I gather by the words of the Apo≈øtle, calling the blood here mentioned the blood of the Covenant; ju≈øt the ≈øame expre≈ø≈øion as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> u≈øed before, <hi>Behold the blood of the Covenant, Exod.</hi> 24.8. And look how the one blood was ≈øprinkled, ≈øo was the other; and what ≈øanctification was wrought by the one, the ≈øame was al≈øo by the other, namely an externall federall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe; they having (both one and other) accepted the blood of the Covenant to be ≈øprinkled upon them, whereby they were ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified thus farre, as to become a ≈øeparate people unto God. So that (notwith≈øtanding all that which hath been objected, or can be) this ≈øtands good, that ≈øanctification is a ble≈ø≈øing of the Covenant of Grace only: And being ≈øo, therefore to prove our ju≈øtification by our ≈øanctification, is not to go a≈øide to a Covenant of works.</p>

And therefore it is, that when the Lord had converted and ≈øanctified the heart of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and made him a new creature, hee did withall thus te≈øtifie unto him, <hi>This day is ≈øalvation come to thy ≈øoule,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9. Some do deny this way of triall, as if no evidence could bee had from our ≈øanctification, till we fir≈øt know our election and ju≈øtification by immediate revelation of the Spirit: This mediate witne≈ø≈øe of the ≈øpirit which is by habituall and inherent graces, is not to be hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto, untill the immediate witne≈ø≈øe hath ≈øpoken.

Thus by the≈øe expre≈ø≈øions taken out of the Apo≈øtles own mouth, we ≈øee clearely who they are whom the Apo≈øtle meaneth by this (we) namely, not we onely who have received that immediate witne≈ø≈øe of the Spirit, a≈ø≈øuring us of our election and ju≈øtification, but we al≈øo which have this work of ≈øanctification wrought in our hearts by the holy Gho≈øt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Becau≈øe though they goe both together in time, yet they are not both alike in re≈øpect of manife≈øtation: Our ≈øanctification is more manife≈øt to us then is our ju≈øtification.

Secondly, becau≈øe our ≈øanctification is a work within us, wrought in out own hearts; Our ju≈øtification is an act of God without us, God not imputing to us our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; but our ≈øanctification is an inward work wrought in

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But by this rea≈øon (may ≈øome ≈øay) a man may as well know his ju≈øtification as his ≈øanctification, becau≈øe we are ju≈øtified by faith, and faith is an inward Grace planted in the heart, as well as any other ≈øanctifying Grace which ≈øprings therefrom. And therefore we may know our ju≈øtification by our faith, as well as by our ≈øanctification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> True, ≈øo farre as we di≈øcerne our faith, we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by di≈øcerne our ju≈øtification al≈øo: But this makes for us, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt us, Though this withall is to be con≈øidered, that faith being as the root of all other Graces, is more hidden then they are, as the root of the tree is more hidden in the earth then the body or branches; but this we ≈øtand not upon: This therefore we would grant that a man may know his ju≈øtification by his faith; but this toucheth not the point in hand. For when we goe about to try our ju≈øtification by our ≈øanctification, and by qualifications inherent in us, in this way of tryall, faith is excluded, as much as any other ≈øanctifying Graces be. And the meaning of tho≈øe that doe oppo≈øe this way of evidencing by our ≈øanctification, is to remove all evidence by any thing in our ≈øelves, whether by faith or by any other Grace, and to urge only the immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Spirit; The ≈øumme is, that this is a ≈øafe way of tryall, being laid down unto us by the Lord him≈øelfe in the Word: And it is a po≈ø≈øible way, in as much as our ≈øanctification is more evident then our ju≈øtification, this being an act of God without us as was ≈øaid before, and that a work within us, which we feele and finde in our own ≈øoules.

As corruption had defiled all, ≈øo Grace ≈øanctifies all: The minde which was darkne≈ø≈øe before is now light in the Lord, to know and under≈øtand the will of God, and to di≈øcerne things that differ: The judgement made to approve the good which is known, the will to de≈øire and endeavour after the doing of it: The con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is made watchfull, and tender, fearefull to offend: The affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ordered aright to love the things which God loveth, and to hate the things which he hateth: The body is made an in≈øtrument to execute and doe that which is holy and good: Both body and ≈øpirit are Gods, ≈øet to doe the things that plea≈øe him, by which he may be glorified: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. all that is within us and without, us is imployed to prai≈øe God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True Sanctification as it doth ≈øanctifie the whole man, ≈øo it doth forme the heart to a clo≈øing with the whole will of God without exception or re≈øervation: when God writes his Law in our hearts, he writes all his Commandements there, as he wrote all of them before in the Tables of ≈øtone; and they being all written in the heart, now we love all the Commandements of it, ≈øaying, as <hi>Paul, The Law is holy, and ju≈øt, and good;</hi> now his Commandements are not burthenous or grievous, all are equall and right, we love all, embrace all, and labour to practice all; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of holine≈ø≈øe towards God, duties of love and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:113533:108"/> towards men, goe hand in hand in the life of a ≈øanctified Chri≈øtian: He makes account he hath done but half his duty, if either of the≈øe be omitted: He counts him≈øelfe as debtor to God and man to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and procure the good of men; and de≈øires to keep a cleare con≈øcience towards both, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. It is but fal≈øe ≈øancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which neglects either of the≈øe duties, or any part of them; when we put on a forme of Religion, and yet deale unrighteou≈øly with men, this is cur≈øed hypocri≈øie: And when we deale ≈øquarely with men, but are carele≈ø≈øe Gallio's in the things of God, this is but a kinde of civill profane≈ø≈øe: there is no true ≈øanctification in one or other of them: True ≈øanctification cleaves to the whole law, and to all the Commandements of it, ≈øeeking to doe and fulfill all: ≈øuch an heart the Lord requires, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. and ≈øuch he works, where he works Grace in truth, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. True ≈øanctification will never ≈øuffer the ≈øoule to finde re≈øt and peace, but only in the way which is called holy: A ≈øanctified ≈øoule may ≈øtep a≈øide into the way which is not good, but it can finde no re≈øt there; Holine≈ø≈øe ≈øtands in a conformity with God: It will not agree with any thing which is contrary to God, or to his will; a godly heart can finde no peace there. As on the one ≈øide a ≈øinfull heart may do the thing that is good, but it takes no plea≈øure in ≈øuch things; ≈øo <hi>contr√†</hi> the ≈øanctified heart, may by occa≈øion and by ≈øtrength of temptation, and prevailing power of inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be drawn to act ami≈ø≈øe; but when hee hath done ≈øo, he finds no re≈øt in his ≈øpirit, till he be returned againe into the way of holine≈ø≈øe which he had turned from. Thus <hi>David</hi> ≈øtept a≈øide, but what peace found he? <hi>Peter</hi> fell into ≈øhamefull denyall, but how grieved was he afterward? Thus <hi>Paul</hi> he confe≈ø≈øed he did the evill that he would not; but how was he pained at the very heart, till he was rid of that body of ≈øinne? It was his continuall vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As the needle in the compa≈ø≈øe may by ≈øhaking be turned from the right point, and from the pole, but it will finde no re≈øt till it be turned to it againe: So here. When therefore the heart ≈øinnes and finds re≈øt in it, and is not labouring to work out the corruption which is within, this is an evill ≈øign and dangerous; this argues a carnall di≈øpo≈øition, and an un≈øanctified Spirit. But when we are grieved for the evill which is in us, when our ≈øinne is counted our mi≈øery, making us lament with <hi>Paul</hi> and ≈øay O mi≈øerable man
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:113533:108"/> that I am &amp;c. and that not only as it troubles the con≈øcience, but as it cloggs the Spirit hindring us in well doing; this is a ≈øign of a ≈øanctified e≈øtate, and ≈øprings from a Spirit of grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. True ≈øanctification will make us mo≈øt wary and watchfull again≈øt tho≈øe ≈øinnes which doe mo≈øt ≈øtaine our holy profe≈ø≈øion and blemi≈øh the glory of Chri≈øt, and make us mo≈øt ≈øtudious of tho≈øe things in which God is mo≈øt glorified: As <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaid of him≈øelfe, <hi>I can doe nothing again≈øt the truth, but for the truth;</hi> ≈øo indeed a ≈øanctified ≈øoule can doe nothing again≈øt Gods glory, but all things for his glory. Sanctity devotes a man unto God, he is for God, not for him≈øelfe, not for the world, he accounts him≈øelfe that he is Gods. If we live we live for God; whether we eat or drink or labour or re≈øt, we doe them for God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. If we get riches, we grow rich for God, to honour God with our riches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. Our whole life is for God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. This is a ≈øancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied di≈øpo≈øition, when it is thus with us: And when otherwi≈øe we eat for our ≈øelves as <hi>Zachary</hi> ≈øpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.6. we labour for our ≈øelves, get riches for our ≈øelves, not caring how our profe≈ø≈øion is blemi≈øhed, and God di≈øhonoured by our worldly and coveteous conver≈øation; this is from the fle≈øh, which loves its own, and minds its own things, and not the things of Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. True ≈øanctification makes a man affect ≈øociety with tho≈øe that are holy: Its a good ≈øigne when the heart doth inwardly cleave to tho≈øe that excell in grace; e≈øpecially, when it is for Grace ≈øake and becau≈øe of the Grace that is in them. There may be an outward complying with them, and ≈øome externall ≈øociety had with them al≈øo, when yet the heart is not with them; there may be ≈øome ≈øutablene≈ø≈øe of di≈øpo≈øition, ≈øome morall qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in a godly ≈øoule, which may give content unto a carnall heart; but to love them inwardly, and that not for any other re≈øpect but for the grace which is in them, this is from a ≈øutable Spirit of grace working in our ≈øelves: Thus it was with <hi>David, P≈øal.</hi> 16.3. and <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119. Come unto mee all yee that feare God &amp;c. and away from me ye wicked, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. True ≈øanctification makes us a≈øpire after communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low≈øhip with God him≈øelfe; it loves fellow≈øhip with the Saints, but re≈øts not in them, but a≈øpires higher; nothing will ≈øatisfie a ≈øanctified ≈øoule, but God; yea, it is God which he loves and

So it is al≈øo in the u≈øe of Ordinances, they are all empty things without God, unle≈ø≈øe the Lord be there; The Word, Prayer, Sacraments, are but leane and empty things, unle≈ø≈øe hee enjoy God in them; He is the fat, the marrow, and ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe of them all: when God meets the ≈øoule in any of the≈øe, it is then ≈øatisfied as with marrow and fatne≈ø≈øe; but when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes and ab≈øents him≈øelfe, it findes no ≈øatiety, no relli≈øh in any thing: The ≈øoule is empty ≈øtill, till <hi>he</hi> fill it, who is the fulne≈ø≈øe of all things: God only doth fill and ≈øatisfie the ≈øoule that is ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; See <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.4. There you ≈øhall ≈øee the children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> and children of <hi>Iudah</hi> together comming to <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> the place of Gods wor≈øhip; but is that all they goe for?

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:113533:113"/> believe, namely becau≈øe God is in power greater then all, and none is able to pull them out of his hand: Indeed till we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, there is no arguing from Gods power; no man can ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly argue that God will out of ≈øtones rai≈øe up children to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> becau≈øe he never promi≈øed it; but when we have the promi≈øe, then we may rea≈øon from his power: And thus did <hi>Abraham</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, I ≈øhall have a Sonne (≈øaith <hi>Abraham</hi>) becau≈øe (though my body bee as good as dead, yet) God is able to doe it. The argument was good, becau≈øe God had before promi≈øed to doe it. So in the ca≈øe in hand; God hath ≈øaid that he will keep us to his heavenly Kingdome; and therefore if he can doe it, he will doe it; he hath engaged all his power and goodne≈ø≈øe to be for our ≈øalvation; God is ours, his power is ours to ≈øtabli≈øh and ≈øtrengthen us that we fall not; yea, here are two immutable things to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us; the power and will of God. The≈øe two are as the two pillars before <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple; <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz: Boaz</hi> ≈øignifying (in him is <hi>≈øtrength</hi>) and <hi>Iachim</hi> (he <hi>will</hi> ≈øtabli≈øh:) the≈øe two pillars ≈øtand together to e≈øtabli≈øh all tho≈øe that are ready to fall; if there be <hi>≈øtrength</hi> in him, he would have us to know that he <hi>will</hi> put it forth for our e≈øtabli≈øhment, that we might bee ≈øupported by his power; his power and will ≈øtand together to ≈øupport us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the gifts of God which accompany ≈øalvation, are given without repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 13.14.

And why are the≈øe things ≈øaid to flow from Gods election, but that we knowing that that foundation of Gods election remaineth ≈øure, we might know that our ≈øtate in Grace is ≈øure al≈øo, as being built on that foundation which cannot be moved?

That prayer of his <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. which he made for us when he was here upon earth, was and is a te≈øtification of the care he hath of us now in heaven: He then prayed, Father keep them in thy name; and the ≈øame doth he for us now: He is not changed, he is ye≈øterday and to day and the ≈øame for ever; he is our faithfull High-Prie≈øt, who beares our names upon his brea≈øt in the holy place he is now entred into, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.29. pre≈øenting us with his heartie≈øt affection unto his Father, he having ≈øet us a ≈øeale upon his heart, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying us in his bo≈øome, and loving us with his bo≈øome love. This comfort Chri≈øt gave unto <hi>Peter; I have prayed for thee</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt) <hi>that thy faith faile not, Luke</hi> 22.32.

One is this: Namely, becau≈øe the Apo≈øtle in writing to vi≈øible Churches, hee knew that in all ≈øuch Churches there were ≈øome, that though they made as faire profe≈ø≈øion as the re≈øt, yet they would in time di≈øcover ≈øome un≈øoundne≈ø≈øe at heart; for their ≈øakes therefore the Apo≈øtle addes the≈øe (Ifs) as if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, if yee be truly grounded on Chri≈øt and ≈øo continue, then ≈øhall yee be pre≈øented blamele≈ø≈øe, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22, 23. but this doth nothing at all tend to weaken the a≈ø≈øurance of tho≈øe that are truly called and ≈øanctified.

               <p n="2">2. It is a ≈øweet and u≈øefull con≈øideration ob≈øerved by that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Lawyer, and active.

Faith makes us ≈øee wherein our ≈øtrength lyeth, not in our ≈øelves, but in God through Chri≈øt; being then ≈øen≈øible of our own infirmity and weakne≈ø≈øe, faith flies unto this power of God to be kept by him: Faith ≈øpeaks in the heart of a Chri≈øtian as <hi>Jeho≈øhaphat</hi> did 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>Lord I know not what to doe, I am not able to ≈øtand again≈øt all this multitude of enemies which be≈øet my ≈øoule on evey ≈øide, but mine eyes are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, I re≈øt on thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. And then the ≈øoule thus looking unto God by the eye of faith, and re≈øting upon his power; now the power of God comes in for our help, ≈øo as faith ≈øtands ≈øtill to ≈øee and behold the ≈øalvation of God; And hereto agrees that of the Prophet <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 26.3. <hi>The Lord keeps in perfect peace the minde which is ≈øtaid on him:</hi> We ≈øtay upon him by faith, and he keeps us in peace and ≈øafety by his power; And to the ≈øame purpo≈øe is that in <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 6. where we are exhorted to ≈øtand fa≈øt in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:113533:116"/> the power of his might; we mu≈øt have recour≈øe unto the power of his might by faith, and then we ≈øhall ≈øtand fa≈øt, and never be moved; Now as wee have ≈øeen that the Lord will pre≈øerve his people in the ≈øtate of Grace to which he hath called them, ≈øo let us con≈øider what grace is herein ≈øhewed unto us from God, and what benefit comes thereby unto our ≈øelves.</p>
               <p>Here is Grace from God; For by Grace we ≈øtand; were we left unto our ≈øelves, we ≈øhould ≈øoone doe as our fir≈øt Father did; There is naturally the ≈øame revoking Spirit in us, as was in him; an aptne≈ø≈øe and inclination of heart, ready to depart away, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. loving to wander, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.10. we have al≈øo the ≈øame Enemy, the ≈øame Tempter to draw us, with like temptations from our communion with God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.41. And in tho≈øe that are not pre≈øerved by Grace, the≈øe things (corruption within, and temptation without) doe prevaile ≈øo farre, as to turn back many who ≈øeemed to begin in the Spirit, to cau≈øe them to make an end in the fle≈øh: They turning back againe after their wa≈øhing, to the wallowing in the mire.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.</note> Its Grace therefore whereby we ≈øtand, el≈øe we ≈øhould fall as well as they.</p>
               <p>And a ≈øingular benefit it is, con≈øidering that without this one, all the former ble≈ø≈øings, to have God to be a God in Covenant with us, to have our ≈øinnes forgiven, to have our natures renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ≈øanctified, all the≈øe (I ≈øay) were evacuated and made as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if this one ble≈ø≈øing of per≈øeverance were wanting; for then we might lo≈øe our intere≈øt in God againe, we might come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine under the guilt of ≈øinne, &amp;c. and what benefit then of all this, that ≈øometime we had God for our God? we had our ≈øinne forgiven, but now all this is di≈øanulled; we have lo≈øt God againe, and are now en≈ønared againe in the ≈ønare of our ≈øinnes: It is therefore no le≈ø≈øe ble≈ø≈øing to be kept in a ≈øtate of Grace, then to be brought into it. And then, con≈øider al≈øo the danger of Apo≈øtacy that the end of ≈øuch is wor≈øe then was their beginning, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. though their beginning was naught, ≈øinfull, and mi≈øerable, yet their end is wor≈øe: And it had been better for them never to have known the way of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, then when they have known it, to turn from it: Such ≈øhall receive the ≈øorer vengeance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. The greater the danger is of falling back, the greater is the ble≈ø≈øing in being pre≈øerved in the grace in which we ≈øtand.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Que≈øt.</hi> But ≈øometimes wee ≈øee Gods faithfull ≈øervants to bee kept ≈øhort in the≈øe outward ble≈ø≈øings; how comes this to pa≈ø≈øe, the Lord having made ≈øuch ample promi≈øes unto them? and how farre forth may any bee a≈ø≈øured to have a ≈øufficiency in the≈øe things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> To the fir≈øt I conceive thus: Fir≈øt, all the promi≈øes of things pertaining to this life are ≈øubordinate and ≈øub≈øervient to the promi≈øes which concern our inward man, and our eternall ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: God doth not promi≈øe us the≈øe outward things, ≈øo as to make again≈øt our ≈øpirituall good, but ≈øo as to further and help it forward: he promi≈øeth them with Chri≈øt, not again≈øt Chri≈øt, nor to hinder his Kingdome in our hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. If it ≈øo fall out, that ≈øufficiency in the≈øe may better us in the inward man, wee ≈øhall not want them; but becau≈øe the Lord ≈øees us ≈øometimes to abu≈øe them to the fulfilling of our wanton de≈øires, to pride, ≈øecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, confidence, and tru≈øting in them; here the Lord is free from his promi≈øe, lea≈øt by filling us with tho≈øe things that are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he ≈øhould empty us of that little grace that is in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there are times of tryall, in which the Lord will try all his children, <hi>The Lord will try the righteous,</hi> ≈øaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 11.5. thus he tryed them in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36, 37. they were tryed with mockings and ≈øcourgings, being de≈øtitute, afflicted and tormented: Thus al≈øo he tryed <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in the wilderne≈ø≈øe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2, 16. and thus he tryed holy <hi>Job;</hi> God will know what is in us; he will ≈øee whether we ≈øerve him for wages, yea, or no; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee would continue to ≈øerve him out of love, though he ≈øhould give us nothing. Hee will ≈øee whether we follow him for loaves, or whether we can be content to cleave to him in wants and nece≈ø≈øities, having nothing. But though the Lord will thus try us, yet the≈øe times of tryall la≈øt not alwayes, the≈øe are not the wayes of Gods ordinary di≈øpen≈øation towards his people: During the≈øe times of tryall, the Lord doth ≈øometimes cut ≈øhort his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:113533:122"/> in outward things, but it is to do them good in the later end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. The hard≈øhips which <hi>I≈ørael</hi> ≈øuffered for awhile in the wilderne≈ø≈øe, was recompenced with a Land flowing with milke and honey.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ≈øometimes God withholds good things from us for a cha≈øti≈øement of our ≈øinne; according to that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. <hi>your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have hindred good things from you;</hi> when wee goe out of the way in which the ble≈ø≈øing falls, its no marvell if it fall be≈øide us; In the≈øe ca≈øes when either by ≈øin we turn a≈øide from the path of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, or if the Lord will take a time to try our uprightne≈ø≈øe before him, or if he ≈øee our enjoying of the≈øe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ble≈ø≈øings would be an hinderance to our ≈øpirituall good, in the≈øe ca≈øes (I ≈øay) Gods children may be exerci≈øed with wants and nece≈ø≈øities, and yet the promi≈øe of God failes not; not in the fir≈øt ca≈øe, becau≈øe the promi≈øe of outward things in the making of it, is ≈øub≈øervient to the ≈øpirituall good of our inward man; nor in the ≈øecond ca≈øe, becau≈øe the Lord hath put an exception of tryall, by which he will try all his: Nor in the third ca≈øe, becau≈øe the≈øe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things are promi≈øed as rewards of Grace, whereby the Lord doth recompence the love and obedience of his people.</p>
               <p>But to the third part of the demand, if it be further que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned how farre forth a childe of God (out of the≈øe ca≈øes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named) may a≈ø≈øure him≈øelfe of the fulfilling of the≈øe promi≈øes unto him: hereunto I an≈øwer thus: Wee mu≈øt con≈øider two things; fir≈øt, what is promi≈øed; ≈øecondly, how and in what manner.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, con≈øider what is promi≈øed; for here may be a mi≈øtake, in taking the promi≈øe to containe more then indeed it doth; when the Lord promi≈øeth, that riches and trea≈øure ≈øhall be in the hou≈øe of the righteous, what doth he meane by riches and trea≈øure? not the riches of a Kingdome; or that which ≈øhall be ≈øufficient for a man of high degree; but ≈øuch a ≈øufficiency as is ≈øutable to every ones e≈øtate and condition which God hath ≈øet them in: That which is want and poverty to one, may be fulne≈ø≈øe and abundance to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: That then is riches to any man, when God gives him ≈øo much as is ≈øufficiently enough for him in his e≈øtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though he may ≈øtill come ≈øhort of many others of higher ranke; this is that which is promi≈øed.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:113533:122"/>
               <p>Secondly, con≈øider in what manner God promi≈øeth the≈øe things, and that is (as was ≈øaid before) as rewards and as fruits of that faith and obedience which he requires of his people; <hi>Dwell in the land and doe good, and thou ≈øhalt be fed a≈ø≈øuredly,</hi> ≈øaith the Prophet, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 37.3. But what is this good that we mu≈øt doe? <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. In generall. Be upright with God in our conver≈øation before him; 2. Walk diligently and faithfully in our particular callings, be not ≈ølothfull and unprofitable unto our ≈øelves: It is the diligent hand that hath the promi≈øe of abundance, <hi>The talk of the lips brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but want, Prov.</hi> 10. 3. And then we mu≈øt depend upon God by faith in the u≈øe of meanes, not tru≈øting either to our own uprightne≈ø≈øe, or to the meanes u≈øed, but re≈øt by faith on the grace of the promi≈øe, as knowing that when we have done all that wee can, both in our generall and particular calling, yet the Lord might ju≈øtly bla≈øt all our endeavours, ≈øo as all our labour and ≈øtrength might be ≈øpent in vaine: Here therefore our confidence mu≈øt be pitcht, not upon our ≈øelves, nor meanes, but look by faith to the ble≈ø≈øing promi≈øed, which ble≈ø≈øing is all in all. Believe and yee ≈øhall pro≈øper, ≈øaid <hi>Ieho≈øhaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.20. and <hi>contra,</hi> if yee believe not, <hi>yee ≈øhall not be e≈øtabli≈øhed,</hi> ≈øaid <hi>I≈øaiah, I≈øai.</hi> 7.9. There is much in the faith of Gods people: Its a ≈øpeciall meanes to obtaine the ble≈ø≈øing: It was u≈øuall with Chri≈øt, when any came unto him for help in outward things, to ask them whether they believed or no; and then he would tell them, according to your faith be it unto you; All Gods ble≈ø≈øings are wrapt within his promi≈øes: And faith is the hand to receive all, whether they be ≈øpirituall ble≈ø≈øings, or outward concerning this life: what≈øoever the ble≈ø≈øings be, if they ≈øpring from Grace, they mu≈øt be received by faith. The hand of Grace gives them, and the hand of faith receives them: And ≈øometimes the want of faith onely, cuts us ≈øhort of the ble≈ø≈øing we might enjoy; we pro≈øper not, becau≈øe we believe not: The ≈øumme is this: Let a man walk uprightly before God in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall calling; Let him be provident and diligent in his particular calling; Let him withall in both the≈øe look by faith to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe of the promi≈øe of God, believing that in this way he will give that which is ≈øufficient for him, Then I ≈øay, that in the ordinary cour≈øe of Gods dealing, hee may be ≈øure the Lord will not be wanting to him, in ≈øuch things as his ≈øtate and condition doth require.</p>

Thus doe and then lay thy life upon it, thou ≈øhalt not want: Bread ≈øhall be given thee, and thy waters ≈øhall not faile; thou ≈øhalt have thy daily portion provided for thee. Though thou ha≈øt not much laid up in ≈øtore for many yeares or dayes, yet thou ≈øhalt have thine Omer day by day.

               <p n="2">II. As in the want, ≈øo in the enjoyment of outward good things, the former con≈øideration gives us direction al≈øo; doe we enjoy them? hath God made good his promi≈øe unto us? have we a portion convenient for us? Then</p>

Though the≈øe outward things be but the ble≈ø≈øings of the left hand, the le≈ø≈øer ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant, yet the Lord would be acknowledged even in the≈øe.

But <hi>Job</hi> abhorred this; ≈øo ≈øhould we; let us in our heart acknowledge that it is not our own hand, but the Lord which hath given us all our abundance of good things: In them ≈øee his bounty towards us.

                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. If we come by them in the way of the Covenant, we walking before God in the way of holy obedience and dependance upon him, Its certain they doe then come to us as ble≈ø≈øings, and are given us by vertue of his Covenant: And therefore it is that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.1, 2, 8, 12. <hi>If thou ≈øhalt diligently ob≈øerve the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements

               <p n="2">2. If they be as bands and cords of love betwixt God and us; as bands to draw us nearer unto him, and as cords to tie us fa≈øter unto him, cau≈øing us to love him more, and to honour him in the u≈øe of tho≈øe good things which we have received from him, doubtle≈ø≈øe they doe then come from his Grace towards us, and are ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant. <hi>I have loved thee</hi> (≈øaith the Lord) in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>and with mercy have I drawn thee;</hi> If God draw us unto him by any meanes, there is mercy in it, and there is a ble≈ø≈øing in it. Take this as a rule for ever, what ever brings us to God is a ble≈ø≈øing; as contrariwi≈øe whatever ≈øeparates us from God is a cur≈øe. And that which cau≈øeth love, comes from love. If the≈øe things work love in our hearts towards God, then doe they come from his love towards us. Con≈øider then, are our hearts carried away from God by the things we enjoy? this is dangerous: But are our hearts thereby more drawn and knit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? then own them as ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant, as ≈øpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the fountaine of Grace which God hath opened to us in Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Sometimes there is much love ≈øeen in a little thing; and ≈øo it is in the≈øe gifts which God gives to his children: The gift may be ≈ømall, but the love is great from which it comes: This love ≈øhould ≈øatisfie, whether the gift we receive from it, be le≈ø≈øe or more: As a younger childe which his Father loves

And this contentation we ≈øhould the rather labour for, becau≈øe if we be not ≈øatisfied with that le≈ø≈øer portion which the Lord be≈øtows upon us, untill we abound, it is ≈øu≈øpicious, and we have cau≈øe to doubt, whether our contentment be not more in the gift then in the grace and love of the Giver; For if it be his love that ≈øatisfies us, why are we not ≈øatisfied when we have le≈ø≈øe, as if we had more? if we have food and rayment (having them from the gift of his Grace) let us therewith bee content. Satisfie us with thy mercy ≈øaith <hi>Mo≈øes, P≈øal.</hi> 90.14. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> could be ≈øatisfied with mercy, though he had but little el≈øe; there is a ≈øatisfying ≈øufficiency in it, if wee can but ≈øee it, and relli≈øh it in the things we enjoy: Let us make ≈øure of this, that what we have, it may come from the hand of Grace, and then let us be contented with it, be it le≈ø≈øe or more.</p>

               <p>Great are the ble≈ø≈øings which God hath promi≈øed to tho≈øe which are the faithfull ≈øeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and therefore as we de≈øire to enjoy the ble≈ø≈øing promi≈øed, ≈øo we mu≈øt ≈øee al≈øo what he requires of us, that he may performe unto us what he hath promi≈øed,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:113533:130"/> and this is called the ≈øtipulation or condition of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And concerning this I will ≈øhew the≈øe foure things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is a condition required.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why the Lord hath put a condition to the promi≈øe of life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What the condition is.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the putting of ≈øuch a condition doth or can ≈øtand with the free Grace of the Covenant, yea or no.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That there is a condition of the Covenant: The Lord doth not ab≈øolutely promi≈øe life unto any; he doth not ≈øay to any ≈øoule, I will ≈øave you and bring you to life, though you continew impenitent and unbelieving, but commands and works us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, and then promi≈øes that in the way of faith and repentance, he will ≈øave us. He pre≈øcribes a way of life for us to walk in, that ≈øo wee may obtaine the ≈øalvation which he hath promi≈øed; he brings us fir≈øt through the doore of faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. And then carries us on in the way of faith, till he bring us to the end of our faith the ≈øalvation of our ≈øoules.</p>
               <p>There are indeed ≈øome promi≈øes which <hi>≈øeeme</hi> ≈øo ab≈øolute as to exclude all condition on our part, as that promi≈øe in <hi>E≈øay</hi> 43.25. <hi>For mine own ≈øake will I put away thy tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, &amp;c.</hi> and ≈øo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.22. Where there is no mention made either of faith or any other Grace in us, as a condition required on our part. But if any ≈øhall hence argue that the promi≈øe of life is ≈øo ab≈øolute as to exclude all re≈øpect unto faith in tho≈øe to whom the promi≈øe is made, and becau≈øe there is no mention made of faith in ≈øuch promi≈øes, therefore there is no intendment of it, as if it were not under≈øtood, but wholly excluded, I may as well argue again≈øt the merits of Chri≈øt al≈øo, and exclude them by the like rea≈øon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there is no mention of them, no more then of faith in tho≈øe ab≈øolute promi≈øes. But as there is no remi≈ø≈øion without the blood of Chri≈øt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. So neither is there without faith in that blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. as God never promi≈øed to forgive us our ≈øins without re≈øpect to Chri≈øt, though Chri≈øt be not alwayes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in every ≈øuch promi≈øe, ≈øo neither doth he promi≈øe to ≈øave without faith, though it be not alwayes mentioned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
               <p>To prove that there is a condition in the Covenant of Grace, it may be made evident ≈øundry wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:113533:130"/>1. From the nature of a Covenant, which is an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ≈øeverall parties Covenanting together upon mutuall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions required on both parties: <hi>Foedus</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Rollock</hi>) is <hi>promi≈ø≈øio ≈øub certa conditione, Roll. de vocatione efficaci:</hi> A man may make a promi≈øe alone without any condition: But a Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly binds both parties, and hath a condition annexed; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Abimeleck</hi> promi≈øe one to another in their Covenant made betwixt them, they mutually binde them≈øelves, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. And ≈øo it is betwixt God and <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.27.</p>
               <p>I grant that the word Covenant is ≈øometimes u≈øed concerning ≈øuch promi≈øes as are without condition, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.9. Where the Lord ≈øpeaking of his purpo≈øe and promi≈øe never to de≈øtroy the earth any more, he calls that promi≈øe his Covenant, though there be no condition there annexed: But the Que≈øtion is not how a word may be u≈øed upon ≈øome ≈øpeciall occa≈øion; but what is the proper nature of a Covenant, which doth require mutuall ≈øtipulation or condition on both parties; This is but one place where the word Covenant is taken for a promi≈øe without a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; more ≈øuch places I know not any in Scripture; and be≈øides there was ≈øpeciall rea≈øon of calling it a Covenant; namely, to ≈øhew the unchangeablene≈ø≈øe of his purpo≈øe touching the mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed, that it is as ≈øure as if we had tyed him thereunto by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, upon ≈øome condition performed by us before hand: But this is not properly a Covenant, where there is not a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall obligation and binding of the parties one to another by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Hereto agreeth that ≈øaying of <hi>Beza,</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua est (inquit) depo≈øiti obligatio inter Deum &amp; Sanctos ip≈øius;</hi> Though on Gods part this obligation is <hi>pror≈øus gratuita,</hi> wholly free, as hee there ≈øpeaks; though Gods binding of him≈øelfe to us bee free, yet ours is not ≈øo to God: But concerning the freene≈ø≈øe of the Covenant, we ≈øhall ≈øpeak hereafter; thus much only for the pre≈øent he affirmes that there is <hi>mutua obligatio,</hi> a mutuall bond or tie, by which God binds us to him≈øelfe, as well as he binds him≈øelfe to us, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But for further confirmation hereof, con≈øider the different kinds of expre≈ø≈øions which the Scripture u≈øeth in ≈øpeaking of the Covenant betwixt God and us: There is mention made of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>promi≈øed;</hi> And there is mention al≈øo of a Covenant

                  <hi>commanded,</hi> not to imply two Covenants, but two parts of the ≈øame Covenant; one part of it ≈øtanding in the promi≈øe from God to us, the other, in duty from us to God: Thus <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12. there is the Covenant which God promi≈øed and by oath ≈øwore unto his people; and then in <hi>Jo≈øh.</hi> 7.11. there is the Covenant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which is the condition on our part required; take away the condition, you mu≈øt al≈øo take away the Covenant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and if there be a Covenant commanded, there mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be a condition.</p>

If the Lord had bound him≈øelfe only, and put no condition upon the Covenant for us, he could not have ≈øaid that he would bring us into the bond of it; But hereby he would teach us, that when he makes with us a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace and mercy, he doth not then leave us at liberty to live as we li≈øt; but he binds us by Covenant to him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:113533:131"/>5. Con≈øider how the name of Covenant is given not only to the promi≈øe which God makes unto us, but to that duty which he requires on our part, to be done by us, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. There the name of Covenant is given to Gods promi≈øe which he makes to us; but afterwards in <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 9. the ≈øame name of Covenant is al≈øo given to the duty required of us, <hi>I will</hi> (≈øaith the Lord to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham) e≈øtabli≈øh my Covenant with thee,</hi> and what is that? <hi>I will be a God unto thee, &amp;c. and thou al≈øo ≈øhalt keep my Covenant,</hi> that is, there is the duty I require of thee, by which thou ≈øhalt te≈øtifie thy ob≈øervance of the Covenant; namely, in circumci≈øing thy ≈øeed.

The giving of the fir≈øt Grace in our calling, goes before our pe≈øonall Covenant betwixt God and us, by which we bind our ≈øelves unto him to take him for our God, to depend upon him, and to ≈øubmit our ≈øelves unto his will; fir≈øt the Lord doth di≈øpo≈øe us and fit us to a walking in Covenant with him, by putting into us his own ≈øpirit, as it is in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. and then he requires an actuall performance of Covenant on our part, to walk according to the Grace received; Look how it was in that Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> ≈øo it is in this Covenant of Grace, in re≈øpect of the point in hand, though otherwi≈øe there be wide differences betwixt them, as we have ≈øeen before; fir≈øt God indues <hi>Adam</hi> with an habituall righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, thereby enabling him for that obedience which he was to walk in, and then having thus qualified him, the Lord enters into a Covenant with him, requiring of him to walk according to all that Law which was ≈øet before him, and in that way of working righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, to look for the life which was promi≈øed him; ≈øo it is here in the Covenant of Grace; fir≈øt, the Lord comes and takes away from us the heart of ≈øtone, that evill heart of unbeliefe, and gives us a ≈øpirit of faith, and renewing Grace, and then draweth the ≈øoule into a Covenant with him, to walk with him in a way of faith, depending upon him by faith, and obeying him by faith: ≈øo looking for the promi≈øe of eternall life; Thus it was with <hi>Abraham;</hi> fir≈øt God gives unto <hi>Abraham</hi> a believing heart, then he comes to him and tells him, <hi>Abraham, I am come to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Covenant with thee:</hi> and withall tells him what are the articles and conditions of the Covenant both on Gods part, and on <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams;</hi> on Gods part, <hi>That he will be to</hi> Abraham <hi>and to his ≈øeed a God to ble≈ø≈øe him, and to be an al≈øufficient good unto him;</hi> and on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part, Requiring, <hi>That he walk before him and be upright, and keep his Covenant which was commanded him;</hi> and ≈øo it is with all the Adult Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> fir≈øt, God gives us a ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, beginning to renew us, then propounds to us the great things of his Covenant which he will be≈øtow upon us, and commands us to depend by faith upon him for the performance of them; and if we thus con≈øider of the giving of the fir≈øt Grace, this doth no whit cro≈ø≈øe the condition of the Covenant, but makes way for it, enabling us to walk in Covenant with God; that ≈øo

               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It is not the having of a condition, but the identity or ≈øamene≈ø≈øe of the condition which makes them the ≈øame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; all Covenants have a condition, but all Covenants are not therefore one and the ≈øame, but do differ according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the conditions which are made; there being then one condition in the Covenant of works, and another in the Covenant of grace, they are therefore di≈øtinct Covenants, though there be a condition in both.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ≈øee there is a condition of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>But (to come to the ≈øecond point before propounded) why (may ≈øome ≈øay) doth the Lord require any condition of us, and not bring us to life and glory without requiring any thing at our hand?</p>

               <p n="3">3. Its al≈øo for the greater con≈øolation of the Saints, that wee ≈øeeing the condition to be wrought in us, and finding our ≈øelves to be guided by his Spirit, and inabled in any gracious mea≈øure to keep the way of his Covenant which he hath appointed for us to walke in, we might thereby have the more ≈øtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation, a≈ø≈øuring our ≈øelves of the fulfilling of his gracious promi≈øe towards us; that his loving kindne≈ø≈øe ≈øhall be for ever and ever on them that fear him, <hi>and keepe his covenant thinking upon his Commandements to do them,</hi> P≈øal. 103.17, 18. And thus both in re≈øpect of glorifying of God, the ≈øtopping of the mouthes of the wicked, and for the comfort of the Saints, it was meet there ≈øhould be a condition annexed to the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to the third point, let us make a little u≈øe of that already delivered.</p>
               <p>If there be a condition of the Covenant, then hence it follows, That for the tryall of our intere≈øt in the Salvation which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant promi≈øeth, there can be no more direct, evident, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way taken, then by examining our ≈øelves concerning the condition of the Covenant, expre≈ø≈øed in the conditionall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes. The promi≈øe of life is made onely to beleevers, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed by other graces accompanying their faith, and therefore ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ≈øometimes ≈øuch as love God, ≈øometimes merciful, poor in heart upright, and ≈øuch other, all the≈øe flowing from faith, faith ≈øhewing it ≈øelfe by them. Now then, faith being the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, (as we ≈øhall ≈øhew afterwards) and being known by the≈øe other graces accompanying it, here is the way for us to try our ≈øelves before God, whether the promi≈øe of ≈øalvation doe belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us even by looking to the condition of Faith, and ≈øuch other graces, as doe accompany it in them that doe beleive: This is ≈øo ≈øure away of tryall, that the Apo≈øtle him≈øelf directs us thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Prove your ≈øelves whether yee be in the faith or no:</hi> If we would know our ≈øelves to be ≈øuch as are not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to be di≈øallowed or rejected, there is no better way to know it then by our faith. And <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us that in this way <hi>we ≈øhall a≈ø≈øure our hearts,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14, 18, 19. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:113533:134"/> doth propound the doubt of a weak beleever, inquiring how he may know that he ≈øhall be ≈øaved; and the Apo≈øtle him≈øelf an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwers his doubt, telling him that it is not by a≈øcending or de≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hither or thither, but by looking to his faith, <hi>For if thou beleeve≈øt with thine heart in the Lord Ie≈øus, thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved,</hi> v. 9. This way of tryal ≈øheweth the true u≈øe of tho≈øe promi≈øes which we call conditional; we do not make the graces expre≈ø≈øed in them as the matter of our righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and yet neither do we ca≈øt them a≈øide as if they were Legall promi≈øes, and not Evangelicall; but the u≈øe of them is thereby to try our ≈øelves by the graces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed in them; and this is the chiefe≈øt way of tryall which the Word doth direct us unto; Yea I doubt not to affirme that if we will in ordinary cour≈øe, have any tryall of our e≈øtates by the Word, we mu≈øt have it in this way, by the conditionall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes; The ab≈øolute promi≈øes do not de≈øcribe the per≈øons to whom the ble≈ø≈øings of the Covenant doe belong; onely the conditionall promi≈øes do point out the per≈øons to be ≈øaved, as the ab≈øolute do ≈øhew the cau≈øe of our ≈øalvation; if therefore we will try, and in a way of tryall have any knowledge of our per≈øonall intere≈øt in the ≈øalvation promi≈øed, we mu≈øt either come to know it by the conditionall promi≈øes, or not have it from the word at all, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yet neither would I make rhe ab≈øolute promi≈øes u≈øele≈ø≈øe, as ≈øome have gone about to do with tho≈øe that are conditionall; I acknowledge they are of ≈øingular u≈øe; Fir≈øt, in that they ≈øhew unto us the onely cau≈øe of our ≈øalvation, even free grace, and no other; Secondly, they are a foundation for the faith of adherence or dependence to ≈øtay upon; they yeeld a ≈øingular incouragement to a poor dejected ≈øoul that finds nothing in it ≈øelf but ≈øin and mi≈øery, with hope to ca≈øt it ≈øelfe upon the free grace of God, ≈øeeing he looks at nothing in us for which he ≈øhould ≈øave us, but onely to glorifie his own grace in us. But ≈øtill though in the≈øe regards there be great u≈øe of the≈øe ab≈øolute promi≈øes, yet the tryall of our e≈øtates is not by them, becau≈øe they doe not note out the per≈øons to whom the ≈øalvation is promi≈øed, but this is done (as was ≈øaid) by the conditionall.</p>
               <p>There be two acts of faith, one of adherence or dependance, another of a≈ø≈øurance; There be al≈øo two kinds of promi≈øes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute and conditionall; marke now how the≈øe doe fit and an≈øwer
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:113533:135"/> one to the other, the ab≈øolute promi≈øes to the faith of adherence, the conditionall to the faith of a≈ø≈øurance; For example, God comes and ≈øayes; <hi>For mine owne ≈øake will I doe thus and thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you in an ab≈øolute promi≈øe;</hi> here is a ground for the faith of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to cleave unto; though I be mo≈øt unworthy, yet I will hang upon this promi≈øe becau≈øe it is for his owne ≈øake that the Lord will perform this mercy, that he may be glorified. There be al≈øo conditionall promi≈øes, <hi>(He that beleeveth ≈øhall be ≈øaved)</hi> by meanes of which (we having the experience and feeling of ≈øuch grace in our ≈øelves) we grow to an a≈ø≈øurance that we are of tho≈øe that he will ≈øhew that free grace upon. And thus the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute promi≈øes are laid before us as the foundation of our ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is wrought in the adhering to the promi≈øe) and the conditionall as the foundation of our a≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>But may not (will ≈øome ≈øay) and doth not the Lord ≈øometimes give comfort to his ≈øervants by an ab≈øolute promi≈øe? and if ≈øo, then what need we looke to tho≈øe that are conditionall?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I doubt not but the Lord doth give refre≈øhings to the ≈øouls of his beloved by ≈øuch ab≈øolute promi≈øes; for there being a ≈øum of grace contained in every promi≈øe, whether ab≈øolute or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, the Lord may let the ≈øoule ra≈øte of the comfort of that grace by what promi≈øe he will when the ≈øoule is taken up with ≈øome deep and ≈øerious meditation of that abundant grace and free goodnes of God towards us, and the minde is fa≈øtned upon ≈øome expre≈ø≈øion of ≈øuch a promi≈øe ≈øetting forth that grace unto us, the Spirit ≈øends down that ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe of grace into our hearts, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us ta≈øte and feel the comfort of it. This none will deny. But 1. the que≈øtion is not, whether we may ta≈øte of comfort by an ab≈øolute promi≈øe; but by what kinde of promi≈øe we are to try our ≈øelves; the Spirit may give refre≈øhing by an ab≈øolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, but our way of tryall is by the conditionall, examining our ≈øelves by the graces expre≈ø≈øed in them, and thereupon making ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our ≈øelves of the mercy promi≈øed, which we cannot doe by the ab≈øolute, there being nothing expre≈ø≈øed in them to helpe us in this way, 2. Though comfort may he had by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute promi≈øe, yet it is never given (if it be true and not a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion) but where the condition of Faith and other graces are in being, and are fir≈øt wrought; otherwi≈øe it is lying, fal≈øe comfort,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:113533:135"/> not true and ≈øaving, 3. Though we may have comfort by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute promi≈øe, yet when times of temptation doe return, when ≈øcruples and doubts doe afterwards ari≈øe in our heart, we mu≈øt then turn to the conditionall promi≈øes, trying whether the graces expre≈ø≈øed in them be wrought in us; and then finding in our ≈øelves that faith and love which is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, we doe thereby grow up in a≈ø≈øurance that the former con≈øolation was no other but the con≈øolation of Gods own Spirit. So that upon the point, here is the u≈øuall and ordinary way of tryall of our e≈øtates, even to try our ≈øelves by the graces expre≈ø≈øed in the conditionall promi≈øes. And though the comfort ≈øo ta≈øted as was before expre≈ø≈øed, be the more ≈øweet and delightfull whiles it is felt, yet the a≈ø≈øurance which we have by the tryall of our graces, is the more con≈øtant and durable. If upon pretence of the ≈øeale and witne≈ø≈øe of the Spirit in an ab≈øolute promi≈øe, any ≈øhall de≈øpi≈øe this way of tryall by the graces that are in them, let them take heed, lea≈øt Sathan (who knows how to transforme him≈øelfe into an Angel of light) doe deceive them with fal≈øe fla≈øhes of comfort, which in the end will cau≈øe them to lie down in ≈øorrow.</p>
               <p>It is but an unplea≈øing bu≈øine≈ø≈øe to ≈øeparate and oppo≈øe the things which God hath ≈øo nearely joyned together, to oppo≈øe the ab≈øolute promi≈øes again≈øt the conditionall, or the conditionall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the ab≈øolute; the Lord hath made no ≈øuch ≈øeparation or oppo≈øition betwixt them; The ab≈øolute and conditionall promi≈øes are both one in ≈øub≈øtance, though they differ in manner of expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For when the Lord ≈øaith, <hi>he will forgive our ≈øins for his own ≈øake, E≈øay</hi> 43. (which is an ab≈øolute promi≈øe) this promi≈øe intends faith in tho≈øe in whom it ≈øhall be fulfilled; though he do forgive our ≈øinnes for his own ≈øake, yet he doth it only to ≈øuch as doe believe; faith therefore is implyed in that promi≈øe, though not expre≈ø≈øed; And on the other ≈øide, when God promi≈øeth life to ≈øuch as doe believe (which is a conditionall promi≈øe) this promi≈øe implies the former freene≈ø≈øe of Grace, as was before expre≈ø≈øed in the ab≈øolute promi≈øe to doe it for his own ≈øake; the expre≈ø≈øing of faith the condition, doth not exclude the freene≈ø≈øe of Grace, nor doth the expre≈ø≈øing of freene≈ø≈øe of Grace exclude the condition; the≈øe two kinde of promi≈øes, help to explaine one another, not to contradict or overthrow the truth of either; When we heare a
<pb n="922" facs="tcp:113533:136"/> conditionall promi≈øe, (believe and be ≈øaved) if any ≈øhall now aske, Why will the Lord ≈øave ≈øuch as believe without works? To this the Lord an≈øwers in the ab≈øolute promi≈øe, <hi>for mine own ≈øake will I doe it;</hi> On the other≈øide, when hearing an ab≈øolute promi≈øe, (As, <hi>for mine own ≈øake will I doe this:</hi>) If any ≈øhall here aske, To whom will the Lord performe this mercy promi≈øed? To this he an≈øwers in the conditionall promi≈øe, <hi>I will doe it to them which doe believe;</hi> ≈øo ≈øweetly doe the≈øe promi≈øes agree betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, helping to explaine and expound one another. Let us not then da≈øh them on again≈øt another, and betwixt them≈øelves they will not jarre. The Apo≈øtle found no di≈øagreement betwixt Grace and Faith, or betwixt being ≈øaved by Grace, and being ≈øaved by Faith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.8. and if Grace and Faith agree ≈øo well, then mu≈øt the ab≈øolute and conditionall promi≈øes agree al≈øo; the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øing the Grace of God as the cau≈øe of our ≈øalvation; the other expre≈ø≈øing the condition (Faith) by which it is received, and our intere≈øt in it di≈øcerned; this way of tryall by conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, Let none count a legall cour≈øe, as not agreeable to the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Go≈øpel, This is that way of tryall which <hi>Paul</hi> (who was no legall Preacher) directed the Saints unto: So doth <hi>Peter</hi> al≈øo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. to 11. v. Some that love to be wi≈øe above that which is written, and not according to ≈øobriety, de≈øpi≈øe this way as fit for novices, but not for ≈øuch as are perfect as they are: They have their a≈ø≈øurance by revelation, ≈øeeing the very book of life un≈øealed and opened unto them, ≈øo that they may ≈øee and reade their own names written in it; it is too low a work for them to de≈øcend into them≈øelves, and to examine how it is with them <hi>within,</hi> whether they be in the faith or no. But if this people have any eare to heare, Let them take heed of ≈øpeaking evill of the way of the Lord, which is ≈øo clearely laid down in the Word; or if they be already hardned in their own way, and being wi≈øe in their own eyes, will count this way legall, and contrary to the free Grace of the Covenant, I doubt not to tell them, that an humble ≈øoule which is able to prove his e≈øtate in life by his faith, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces accompanying it, as holy mourning for ≈øinne (which they ≈øet ≈øo light by) love of God, and of the bretheren, care to plea≈øe God, and ≈øuch like, ≈øhall finde more ≈øetled and ≈øure comfort, in the truth of the≈øe, then they ≈øhall doe in their fancyed

The≈øe bonds of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are not like the fetters of a pri≈øon; they are like the plea≈øing bonds of wedlock; <hi>(vincula nuptiarum)</hi> which every one gladly enters into; Oh let us love the≈øe bonds; give up both our hands unto the Lord; yea, and our hearts al≈øo, to be bound in them for ever; the≈øe are ≈øweet bonds, they work no griefe; ≈øeek not therefore to break them, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 2. nor ca≈øt them from you; ≈øay not we will be our own, and walk by our will; ≈øuch lawle≈ø≈øe and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious ≈øpirits as will be at liberty, they ≈øhall be at liberty to their wo: they ≈øhall have ≈øuch a liberty as <hi>Jeremy</hi> threatned to the rebellious Jewes, a liberty to the ≈øword, to the famine, and to the pe≈øtilence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. a liberty to goe to hell to their eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction; a liberty with a cur≈øe; granted unto them in wrath, which ≈øhall end in chaines of everla≈øting darkne≈ø≈øe, and bring them into that pri≈øon from whence there is no going out: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all ≈øuch as look for the ble≈ø≈øing and life promi≈øed in the Covenant, Let them walk faithfully in the condition of it, and in this way expect the mercy which is promi≈øed.</p>
               <p>Thus wee have ≈øhewed; Fir≈øt, That there is a condition of the Covenant; Secondly, Why the Lord hath put a condition unto it.</p>

               <p>The condition then of the Covenant of Grace is faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. <hi>If thou believe≈øt in the Lord Je≈øus, thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved;</hi> ≈øo <hi>Acts</hi> 18.31. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. hence in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. The

               <p>
                  <hi>Que≈øt.</hi> But why is faith made the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. The ble≈ø≈øing of life promi≈øed, is not in our ≈øelves, but in Chri≈øt; Chri≈øt is life, and he which hath the Sonne hath hath life, and he which hath not the Son hath not life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. We are dead, <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 3.3. and our Works are dead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. there is no life in them, <hi>they</hi> cannot bring life unto them that doe them; nor can <hi>wee</hi> quicken our own ≈øoules, but Chri≈øt is the life of men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 3.4. and the way to receive Chri≈øt, and the life which is in him, is only by faith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. unbeliefe rejects Chri≈øt and puts him away; But faith as an hand puts forth it ≈øelfe to receive him in whom our life is: If we had life in our ≈øelves, and could have found it in our own works, it had then been needle≈ø≈øe to appoint faith as the condition of the Covenant; but being that both we our ≈øelves are dead in ≈øinne, and our works are dead works, nothing but death to be found in either; therefore its required that wee believe in Chri≈øt, that we may receive life from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The condition of the law is now become impo≈ø≈øible unto us, through the infirmity of our fle≈øh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and therefore the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>that the Law cannot po≈ø≈øibly give life, Gal.</hi> 3.21. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord would go that way with us no more; the Lord ≈øaw by <hi>Adam,</hi> what would be the fruit of that condition; if we had been put upon the ≈øame as <hi>Adam</hi> was, we ≈øhould have done as he did; we ≈øhould have ≈øhewed our ≈øelves men, like men tran≈øgre≈ø≈øing the Covenant, as <hi>Ho≈øeah</hi> ≈øpeaks, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 6.7. This condition being above our ability to performe, the Lord hath in goodne≈ø≈øe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed another, which is po≈ø≈øible through grace to be fulfilled by us, having now received a ≈øpirit of faith, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.)

               <p>By faith we are made heires and owners of all the good things of this life; We are ≈øonnes by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. and being ≈øonnes we are al≈øo heires, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. even heires of the world, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. and if by faich we be partakers of Chri≈øt, then are we with him intere≈øted in all other things al≈øo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. yea, all things are ours, whether things pre≈øent or things to come, all are ours, we being Chri≈øts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>

                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> This was the old plea of loo≈øe Libertines in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles times; I have faith ≈øaith one, and though I have no works, yet my faith will ≈øave me; But under≈øtand, O thou vaine man (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle <hi>James,</hi> chap. 3.) that if thy faith be without works, ≈øuch faith is vaine, but like a dead carka≈ø≈øe without ≈øoule or ≈øpirit, it is dead in it ≈øelfe, and leaves the ≈øoule in death, wanting life in it ≈øelfe, and yeelding no living fruit, it cannot bring life unto the ≈øoule.

                  <hi>Que≈øt.</hi> 2. But whereas in ≈øpeaking of faith, wee ≈øpeak ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the habit, ≈øometimes of the act of it; It may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded which of the≈øe is the condition of the Covenant? whether is it the habit or the act of faith which is required of us?</p>

                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It is the latter, that is, the act, faith acting and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the promi≈øe, and from the promi≈øe, and cau≈øing us to live by faith in the promi≈øe, according to that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>the life which I now live, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God;</hi> the habit is freely given us, and wrought in us by the Lord him≈øelfe, to inable us to act by it, and to live the life of faith; and then we having received the gift, the habit, then (I ≈øay) the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us that we ≈øhould put forth acts of faith, both by waiting upon him, to receive from him all the good which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, and by walking in all obedience of faith, in an humble ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to his will; this work of faith the Apo≈øtle ≈øhews fully to have been in tho≈øe Saints, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. both in expecting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, with patient ≈øuffering under the hope of it, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to any Commandement of God; and the≈øe <hi>acts</hi> of faith are implyed in that expre≈ø≈øion of <hi>walking</hi> by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and the <hi>work</hi> of faith, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 1.3. and in that faith is ≈øaid to <hi>work</hi> by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. all tending to ≈øhew that it is the act and work of of faith which is required on our part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rea≈ø.</hi> 1. It is the act of faith which receives the promi≈øe, and Chri≈øt in the promi≈øe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. A man may have an hand and yet not have the gift which is offered him unle≈ø≈øe hee put forth his hand to receive it; faith is the hand of the ≈øoule, and the putting of it forth is the act by which wee receive Chri≈øt offered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look as it was with <hi>Adam</hi> in that Covenant made with him, he had an habituall righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe within him; but that was not the condition of the Covenant betwixt God and him, but the acting of that inward habit in acts of obedience, was the condition

               <p n="3">3. It is not an habit of faith, but a life of faith which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the Saints that are in Covenant with God; it is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit which enables and fits us to live by faith; but the life of faith con≈øi≈øts in the acts of faith, put forth according to the ≈øeverall occa≈øions we meet withall, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There mu≈øt needs be a difference betwixt that which God promi≈øeth as a part of the Covenant on his part, and that which he requires of us on our part; now the habit is that which God promi≈øeth to us: when he ≈øaith, <hi>I will give you a new heart, &amp;c.</hi> and this he worketh in us in our effectuall calling; and then the acting of that faith received, is that which is required on our part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Que≈øt.</hi> But what is that act or acts of faith, by which we perform the condition of the Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. Fir≈øt, there is an act of faith by which we doe (as it were) fir≈øt clo≈øe with the Covenant revealed and offered unto us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is al≈øo another act of it, by which we are carried on to an an≈øwerable walking before God according to the Covenant made with him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the former before we give a direct an≈øwer, we mu≈øt lay down the≈øe two grounds.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, That in the making up of the Covenant betwixt God and us, God is fir≈øt with us, he is the fir≈øt mover, he begins with us, before we begin with him; we ≈øhould never ≈øeek to be in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, if he did not allure us, and draw us unto him, Thus in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37. <hi>I will bring them</hi> (≈øaith the Lord) <hi>into the bond of the Covenant;</hi> It is the Lord which brings them; they doe not fir≈øt offer them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>And fir≈øt God prepares his own way for entering into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, and then he fini≈øheth the work; and in this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he doth the≈øe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He breaks us off from our Covenant with Hell and Death, makes us ≈øen≈øible of our undone e≈øtate, makes us ≈øee that we
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:113533:140"/> are without God, without Chri≈øt, without hope, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2. that we are not under mercy, that wee are not of his people, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He opens unto us his minde and will, ≈øhewing him≈øelfe willing to receive us to grace, and to enter into a new Covenant with us, yet againe to take us to be his people, and hee to be our God; he goes into the ≈øtreets and open places as it is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 21. and there makes publike proclamation, <hi>Ho, ho, every one that will, Come yee unto me, and I will make an everla≈øting Covenant with you, E≈øay</hi> 55.3. <hi>E≈øay</hi> 65.1. yea more, he comes and be≈øeeches us to be reconciled unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and ≈øpeaks to us as pittying us; <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. and lamenting over us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. thereby to per≈øwade us to come into a Covenant with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the hearing of the≈øe promi≈øes and offers of grace, the Lord u≈øually ≈øcattereth ≈øome little ≈øeeds of faith in the hearts of tho≈øe that he will bring unto him≈øelfe; which ≈øeed being ≈øown, doth ≈øometimes quickly put forth, and acts towards the Covenant propounded, and layes hold of it, as we ≈øee in <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Jaylor, <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and ≈øuch others; but ≈øometimes (and that mo≈øt u≈øually) before that faith hath done any great thing in ≈øeeking after God, to make a Covenant with him, the Lord doth againe withdraw him≈øelfe, and goes away as, <hi>Ho≈øeah</hi> 5. end: hiding him≈øelfe, as if he would regard us and look after us no more; ≈øo that now if we will get into Covenant with him, we mu≈øt ≈øeek after him, as he before ≈øought after us, and mu≈øt ≈øue unto him for grace, to take us into Covenant with him≈øelfe; and herein faith begins to ≈øhew it ≈øelfe, beginning to work and move towards the Covenant which the Lord offereth to make with us.</p>
               <p>For though the Lord hath withdrawn him≈øelfe, yet he hath left ≈øuch a touch of his Spirit upon the heart as makes the ≈øoule affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate towards him, ≈øo as now it cannot re≈øt, but feeling its own wo, being without God, and without Covenant, and having heard of the Lords willingne≈ø≈øe to enter into a Covenant with us, it now begins to ≈øeek after the Lord, to be in Covenant wirh him; This is the fir≈øt ground, that God is fir≈øt, he begins with us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ≈øecond is, that what≈øoever faith doth in ≈øeeking to enter into Covenant with God, it doth it alwayes in that way, and according to that order in which the Lord hath gone before us,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:113533:140"/> in the offer of his Covenant unto us; faith doth alwaies follow the Word, and doth nothing but as it hath a word of Faith to guide its way, it goes ≈øtep by ≈øtep as it hath the light of the word directing and going before; faith doth not pre≈øcribe unto God, it will not pre≈øume to appoint the conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, onely it an≈øwers and applyes it ≈øelfe to Gods offer, taking conditions of peace, but giving none. It doth not ≈øeek to wind about the promi≈øe of grace to our own minde and will. It doth not ≈øay I will have it thus, thus it ≈øhall be, or el≈øe I will admit of no conditions of peace; but the ≈øoul now finding that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verla≈øting e≈øtate of it for weal or woe, life or death, ≈øtands at the meer good plea≈øure and mercy of God; and knowing that either it mu≈øt ≈øubmit to that way of the Covenant, and to tho≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which the Lord is plea≈øed to ≈øet down, or it mu≈øt peri≈øh for ever; it gladly comes in humbly accepting the offer of grace, in the ≈øame way as it is tendred and offered unto us of God.</p>
               <p>Here then (that we may ≈øee how faith clo≈øeth with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant propounded) we mu≈øt ≈øee fir≈øt how God offers him≈øelfe in his Covenant unto us. Now in that main promi≈øe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (which is indeed the ≈øum of all) <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> God offers him≈øelf unto us two wayes, (as hath been before ≈øhewed in the opening of that promi≈øe,) Fir≈øt, he offers him≈øelfe unto us as a God of mercy to pardon us; as a God of ble≈ø≈øing to ble≈ø≈øe us with all ≈øufficient ble≈ø≈øings. 2. As a God over us, and above us, to order us and to rule us in all our wayes, to governe us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne will that he may be glorified in us; Thus God offers him≈øelfe unto us in his Covenant, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now the an≈øwer is ready to the que≈øtion propounded, how faith doth act in clo≈øing with the Covenant; the work of faith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is to carry the ≈øoule towards the Covenant in the ≈øame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and way as it is propounded; Fir≈øt accepting the grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, re≈øting upon God for all the mercy which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed. 2. Taking God to bee a God over us ≈øubmitting to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and authority, to command us and to rule us in all things according to his own will; the≈øe two things faith doth, and ≈øo takes hold of the Covenant in the ≈øame way and order as God offers it. 1. God makes him≈øelf known to us as a God of mercy, gracious, long-≈øuffering, pardoning iniquity, tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:113533:141"/> and ≈øin, he offers him≈øelfe to be reconciled unto us, though we have rebelled again≈øt him, promi≈øing to be a Father unto us, and to accept of us as his ≈øons and daughters in his beloved.</p>
               <p>Now the worke of Faith in re≈øpect of this offer of grace is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accept the grace offered, to lay hold on it and take it unto our ≈øelves being ≈øo freely offered; Faith brings nothing to God of our owne, it offers nothing to ≈øtand in exchange for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered; it receives a gift, but giveth no price. The Lord holds out and offers the free grace of the Covenant; faith receives it, and makes it our owne. Hence is that expre≈ø≈øion u≈øed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in <hi>E≈øay</hi> 56. where we are ≈øaid to lay hold of the Covenant; God holds it forth, and we take hold of it, the hand of grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it, and the hand of faith receives it and makes it our owne, and this it doth by ≈øuch ≈øteps and degrees as the≈øe that follow, wherein though I ≈øhould not limit the Lords dealing with all his, yet I will ≈øhew what I conceive is the mo≈øt u≈øuall and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cour≈øe of Gods di≈øpen≈øation towards tho≈øe whom he brings into Covenant with him≈øelfe: Here then faith clo≈øeth with the Covenant in this manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By hearing the great things propo≈øed in the Covenant, it ≈øtirs up in the heart a deep and ≈øerious con≈øideration of the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed condition of tho≈øe people that are in Covenant with God; Oh what a ble≈ø≈øed e≈øtate is it (thinkes ≈øuch a one,) to be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, to be one of his covenanted people? It makes him ≈øay with <hi>Mo≈øes, Ble≈ø≈øed art thou O I≈ørael, a people ≈øaved by the Lord, Deut.</hi> 33. It ≈øaith with <hi>David, No people O Lord, is like thy people I≈ørael, whom thou ha≈øt redeemed unto thy ≈øelfe,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.23. Time was when we counted the proud ble≈ø≈øed, and placed our felicity in other things, as in riches, preferments, favour, and credit with men, &amp;c. but now the≈øe are become vile and things of no value; faith makes us change our voice, and to ≈øpeake with a new tongue, and to ≈øay, not, Ble≈ø≈øed are the people that be ≈øo, but, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are the people who≈øe God is the Lord, P≈øal.</hi> 144. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This high e≈øteeme of grace being accompanied with a ≈øence of the want of it, wee ≈øeem unto our ≈øelves as undone men, lo≈øt, wretched, mi≈øerable. The poor ≈øoul thinkes with it ≈øelfe, no ≈øin like my ≈øin, no mi≈øery like my mi≈øery: I am ≈øeparated from
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:113533:141"/> the Lord, an alien from his people; Oh ble≈ø≈øed are they that are are at peace, and in covenant with him! this is now the onely pearle of price; the rich trea≈øure in the field, for which ≈øuch a one is content to give all the ≈øub≈øtance of his hou≈øe. In the prodigall when he began to thinke of returning to his father, the≈øe two things were found in him.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, a deep ≈øence of his owne mi≈øery, <hi>(I die for hunger.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a con≈øideration of the wellfare of tho≈øe that were in his Fathers hou≈øe <hi>(they have bread enough.)</hi> So it is with tho≈øe poor ≈øoules in which faith begins to work, to draw them back into Covenant with God; ≈øen≈øible are they of their own woe, highly al≈øo doe they prize the excellency of grace, if by any means they might attain to have a part in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This high e≈øteem of grace, and being in Covenant with God, begets a longing de≈øire of it; good being beleived, cannot but be de≈øired, and longed for, and therefore faith now belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the benefit of being in favour and Covenant with God, it cannot but work de≈øires after it; de≈øire naturally ≈øpringeth from the apprehen≈øion of any good made knowne. Faith is both in the under≈øtanding and in the will; as it is in the under≈øtanding, it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the eye to ≈øee, and clearly to di≈øcerne the ble≈ø≈øing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and then ≈øtirs up the will to pur≈øue and de≈øire the attaining of the grace revealed: Never did <hi>David</hi> more long for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> then ≈øuch a ≈øoul touched with the ≈øence of ≈øin, doth de≈øire to be at peace with God and in covenant with him, and therefore it is that they are ≈øaid to <hi>thir≈øt after the the Lord,</hi> P≈øal. 42.2. <hi>to pant after him,</hi> P≈øal. 42.1. to ga≈øpe after him, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119. longing for communion and peace with him. Thus in <hi>E≈øay</hi> 26.9. <hi>with their ≈øoules they de≈øire him in the night, and with their ≈øpirit in the morning;</hi> the de≈øire of their ≈øoul is ≈øet upon him, and cannot be ≈øatisfied by any thing without him; peace with him is their life; and to be ≈øeparated from him, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as the ≈øhadow of death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith being yet weak, and but as in the bud, or in the ≈øeed, and being yet unacquainted with the Lords dealing with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not knowing how he u≈øeth by terrors of death to bring them to life and peace; hence it comes to pa≈ø≈øe that the ≈øoule being pre≈ø≈øed with ≈øence of ≈øin, therefore though its de≈øires be ≈øtrong,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:113533:142"/> yet hope of obtaining is but feeble and vveak, vve ≈øeeming to our ≈øelves utterly unworthy (as indeed we are) and uncapable (which we are not) of ≈øo high a priviledge as this is, to be in favour and Covenant with the mo≈øt high God. Here therefore faith is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with many thoughts, thereby to ≈øupport and keepe up the heart in hope, carrying the eye of the ≈øoul towards God, though as beholding him afarre off; faine would the poor ≈øoul be joyned to the Lord, <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 56. but being as yet di≈ømayed with the ≈øence of ≈øin, he ≈øtands like the poor Publican afar off, as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to come neere into the pre≈øence of the holy God; as yet faith can ≈øcarce ≈øpeak a word to God, it cannot come neer to call upon him, only it can with <hi>Ionah</hi> look towards his holy Temple, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the poor weak babe which lies in the cradle, being both ≈øick, and weak and ≈øpeechle≈ø≈øe, and can onely look towards the mother for helpe, the ca≈øt of the eye (after a ≈øort) expre≈ø≈øing and ≈øignifying what it would ≈øay: Thus doth faith being yet weak, it would ≈øpeak unto God but cannot, onely it hath its eye towards heaven, looking for grace and mercy according to <hi>Ieho≈øhaphats</hi> ≈øpeech, <hi>Our eyes are towards thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. It hungers and thir≈øts after grace, but feares it ≈øhall never be ≈øatisfied; it feeles a need and faine would have; but ≈øence of unworthine≈ø≈øe, con≈øciou≈øne≈ø≈øe of manifold ≈øinnes, the ≈øentence of the Law like the thundering and lightning at Mount Sinai, all of them being ≈øharpned by Satans working in them and with them, doe ≈øtrike ≈øuch a fear into the heart, (as was in <hi>I≈ørael</hi> then,) that though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires be ≈øtirring and working, yet hope is very feeble, cau≈øing us to doe as <hi>I≈ørael</hi> did there, who though they heard the Lord ≈øay, I am the Lord your God, yet the terror of the thunder made them to ≈øtand afar off; and ≈øo we, we hear the Lord offering to be our God in covenant with us, but ≈øuch are the di≈øcouragements that we dare not come near to ≈øeek after the grace which is revealed; Hitherto therefore the mind of the poor ≈øinner de≈øiring to bee in Covenant with God, is unquiet within it ≈øelfe, hurried too and fro finding no re≈øt; it heares of peace with God, but feels it not; but in ≈øtead of peace, finds trouble, feare, doubtings, di≈øcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to keep it off from the way of peace; faith being yet yong and faint, hath much adoe to ≈øu≈øtain the heart in any hope that it ≈øink not down in di≈øcouragement. But yet though it bee
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:113533:142"/> weak, it will be doing what it is able; ≈øetting the minde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider the promi≈øes, and encouragements which God hath given us in his word; how hee invites all to come unto him, even every one that thir≈øts, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 55. telling us, That <hi>who≈øoever comes unto him, he will not ca≈øt away, Joh.</hi> 6.37.</p>
               <p>And hence, while the minde is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with the≈øe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ≈øo great a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe as making a Covenant of peace with the high God, and about ≈øo great an affaire as the life and ≈øalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ≈øoule, cannot be tran≈øacted in a tumult, Therefore</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the fourth place, faith takes the ≈øoule a≈øide, and carries it into ≈øome ≈øolitary place; that there it may be alone with it ≈øelfe, and with God, with whom it hath to doe. This bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other occa≈øions, cannot be done together, and therefore the ≈øoule mu≈øt be alone, that it may the more fully commune with it ≈øelfe, and utter it ≈øelfe fully before the Lord; Thus the poore Church in the time of her affliction, when the Lord ≈øeemed to hide him≈øelfe from her, ≈øhee ≈øate alone, as ≈øhe ≈øpeaks, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.28, 29. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.17. <hi>I ≈øate alone, becau≈øe of thy plague: The way of the Lord is prepared in the De≈øert, E≈øay</hi> 40.3. when the Lord will come to the ≈øoule, and draw it into communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe; he will have his way hereto prepared in the De≈øert; not in the throng of a City, but in a ≈øolitary De≈øert place, he will allure us, and draw us into the Wilderne≈ø≈øe, from the company of men, when he will ≈øpeak to our heart, and when he prepares our heart to ≈øpeak unto him, <hi>Ho≈øeah</hi> 2. Not that ≈øuch a one doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øe or neglect the fellow≈øhip of Gods people, but he now ≈øees and knows full well, that his help is not in man, and therefore waits not upon the ≈øonnes of <hi>Adam, Mich.</hi> 5.7. He is glad to hear of any hope, and how others have beene ≈øuccoured and pulled out of the like di≈øtre≈ø≈øe, &amp;c. but though he hath an eare open unto the≈øe and the like helps, yet the ≈øoule cannot re≈øt in them, but mu≈øt retire it ≈øelfe, and get alone, where it may think its full, and ≈øatisfie it ≈øelf;e in thoughts of its own e≈øtate, and of the offers and promi≈øes of Grace, which God hath made to ≈øuch lo≈øt ≈øinners: And whiles the ≈øoule is thus alone, with it ≈øelfe and with God, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thinking of its own mi≈øery and ≈øinne, ≈øometimes of the Lords mercy now pre≈øented in ≈øuch and ≈øuch promi≈øes; ≈øometimes calling to minde how others have found favour with God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:113533:143"/> their ≈øinnes, ≈øometimes thinking what ≈øhould move the Lord thus to invite us, and call us unto him, and to give us the≈øe de≈øires after him; why (thinks the ≈øoule) ≈øhould the Lord doe thus, if there were no hope that he would receive me? whiles I ≈øay, the ≈øoule being alone, is thus exerci≈øed in the≈øe thoughts, at length the fire kindles, ≈øo as the ≈øoule can now re≈øt no longer, but a ≈øpirit of faith being within, like fire in the bones, the heart hitherto having beene as a Wine-ve≈ø≈øell, which hath had no vent, yet now the ≈øpirit within, compels him to open his lips, and to utter before the Lord the meditations of his heart: And therefore</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the fifth place, the ≈øoule re≈øolves now to go to the throne of Grace, ≈øuing for Grace, proving whether the Lord will bee gracious and mercifull, to accept of a reconciliation; faith ≈øpeaks within, as they did in <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.9. <hi>who can tell whether the Lord will return &amp;c.</hi> and as <hi>Amos</hi> 5.15. <hi>It may be the Lord may yet be mercifull;</hi> ≈øuch an one cannot yet ≈øay that he will, yet knowes not but he may be gracious, and therefore doth as tho≈øe lepers in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.3. who knowing that they were ≈øure to peri≈øh if they ≈øate ≈øtill, re≈øolved to try what might befall them in going into the Camp of the <hi>Aramites;</hi> and as <hi>E≈øther</hi> who would try whether the King would hold out his golden Sceper towards her, yea or no; ≈øo the poore ≈øinner, knowing how it is with him, and thinking hee mu≈øt peri≈øh if he thus continue, and hearing al≈øo ≈øuch gracious invitations, &amp;c. thereupon re≈øolves to goe and ≈øeek the Lord beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Grace and acceptance before him. (Doth the Lord ≈øay, ≈øeek yee my face? the heart an≈øwers within, Lord I will ≈øeek thy face; Doth the Lord ≈øay, Come unto me? the heart an≈øwereth, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.22.) And now the ≈øoule betakes it ≈øelfe unto God, ≈øending up complaints again≈øt it ≈øelfe, with lamentations for its own ≈øinfull rebellions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with ≈øtrong cryes to heaven, with ≈øighes and groanes of Spirit which cannot be expre≈ø≈øed; it confe≈ø≈øeth with grief and bitter mourning, all former iniquities, ≈ømites upon the thigh with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting <hi>Epharim,</hi> lies down at Gods foot-≈øtoole, putting its mouth in the du≈øt, acknowledging Gods righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe if he ≈øhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and ca≈øt off for ever, and yet withall pleads for Grace, that it may be accepted as one of his; It ≈øayes unto God, <hi>Lord, I have
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:113533:143"/> nothing to plead why thou mai≈øt not condemn me; but if thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, thy mercy ≈øhall appeare in me, thou mai≈øt ≈øhew forth all thy goodne≈ø≈øe; take away therefore all mine iniquities, and receive mee graciou≈øly, Ho≈øeah</hi> 14.3. It pleads Gods promi≈øe, Lord, thou ha≈øt ≈øaid thou wilt be gracious; Lord make good this word to the ≈øoule of thy ≈øervant, be my God, my mercifull God, and make me thy ≈øervant; thus the ≈øoule lies at the throne of Grace and pleads for Grace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As faith is thus earne≈øt in ≈øuing to God for Grace and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, ≈øo it is no le≈ø≈øe vigilant, and watchfull in ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and taking notice what an≈øwer comes from the Lord, how he an≈øwers the de≈øires we have pre≈øented before him. As the pri≈øoner at the barre, not only cries for mercy, but marks every word which falls from the Judges mouth, if any thing may give him hope, and as <hi>Benhadads</hi> ≈øervants lay at catch with the King of <hi>I≈øra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> to ≈øee if they could take occa≈øion by any thing which fell from him, to plead for the life of <hi>Benhadad;</hi> ≈øo doth the poore ≈øoule that is now pleading for life and grace, it watcheth narrowly to ≈øee if any thing may come from God, any intimation of favour, any word of comfort that may tend to peace; thence it is that the Saints have ≈øo often called upon God for an≈øwer of their prayers; they thought it not enough to pray, but they would ≈øee how the Lord an≈øwered them, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 102.1, 2. Thus <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>O let me heare joy and gladne≈ø≈øe, &amp;c. David</hi> did not only pray for mercy, but de≈øires to heare from heaven a word ≈øpoken to his con≈øcience, by which he might know he was accepted; though <hi>David</hi> was not in the beginning of that work we now ≈øpeak of, yet the ca≈øe is alike, he was now in his own ≈øence as if he had been to begin anew, and thus in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>I will heare what the Lord will ≈øay, for he will ≈øpeak peace unto his people, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. As faith doth thus wait for an an≈øwer from God, ≈øo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe according as the Lord doth either an≈øwer or not an≈øwer, ≈øo doth faith demeane it ≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Sometimes he an≈øwers not, to our ≈øence (I mean) and di≈øcerning, as we ≈øee in <hi>Davids</hi> ca≈øe; he felt him≈øelfe as one for≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and prayed unto God, but found no audience, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 22. What doth faith in this ca≈øe? it followes God ≈øtill, and cryes after him with more ≈øtrength and earne≈øtne≈øs, as re≈øolving never to give over,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:113533:144"/> till the Lord either ≈øave or de≈øtroy; if the Lord will de≈øtroy, yet the ≈øoule chu≈øeth to die at Gods foot, as <hi>Joab</hi> did at the hornes of the Altar, when he was bidden to come forth from thence, to take his death in another place; Nay (≈øaith <hi>Ioab) but I will die here;</hi> Here the humbled ≈øoule doth as that woman did in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. ≈øhee ≈øues to Chri≈øt, but Chri≈øt ≈øeemes to have no regard of her, gives her not one word, but ≈øhee ≈øeeks ≈øtill; ≈øtill ≈øhe cryes after him, and though ≈øtill repul≈øed, yet ≈øhee comes a third time, and cryes, <hi>Lord help me;</hi> and though ≈øtill the Lord gives her another repul≈øe, yet ≈øtill ≈øhe hangs upon him, and follows him for mercy, and would never give over till ≈øhe he had gotten even what ≈øhee de≈øired. Even as Chri≈øt in his agony, when he ≈øaw deliverance came not, he prayed more earne≈øtly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44. ≈øo doth the poore ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the time of his agony, when he is ≈øtriving, as for life, and death; if help come not at fir≈øt call, he prays againe, and that more earne≈øtly; faith will be urgent with God, with an humble impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and the more ≈ølack the Lord ≈øeemes to be in an≈øwering, the more in≈øtant is faith in plying God with prayers. It will be wra≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did with the Angel; it will not re≈øt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ble≈ø≈øing, it will take no denyall, but will crave ≈øtill, as hee did, <hi>ble≈ø≈øe me, even me al≈øo, ≈øend me not away without a ble≈ø≈øing;</hi> it re≈øolves to wait, and look up, <hi>untill the Lord ≈øhew mercy, P≈øal.</hi> 123.2. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.49, 50.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sometimes againe the Lord doth an≈øwer, but yet he ≈øpeaks but as out of the dark cloud giving ≈øom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> little ea≈øe, but not ≈øpeaking full peace; much like as he ≈øpake to the woman, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Goe thy way and ≈øinne no more,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt; he doth not ≈øay, goe in peace, thy ≈øinne is forgiven thee (that had been a word of full comfort) but <hi>goe thy way and ≈øinne no more;</hi> a middle kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, neither a≈ø≈øuring her that her ≈øinne was pardoned, nor yet putting her out of hope, but it might be forgiven. And hereby faith gets a little ≈øtrength, and looks after the Lord with more hope, and begins to plead with God, as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did, Lord thou ha≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to ≈øhew grace unto thy ≈øervant; goe on Lord to manife≈øt in me all thy goodne≈ø≈øe; here faith takes a little hold on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, though with a feeble hand, as yet ≈øhaking and trembling for want of ≈øtrength, and yet now it begins to follow the Lord with more encouragement, as finding that its former ≈øeeking hath not been wholly in vaine.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:113533:144"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Sometimes againe the Lord ≈øpeaks more fully and ≈øatisfactorily to the ≈øoules of his people; applying ≈øome promi≈øe of Grace to the con≈øcience by his own ≈øpirit, letting the ≈øoule feele and ta≈øte the comfort of ≈øuch a promi≈øe, more effectually then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it could before; it hath often heard and thought on ≈øuch a promi≈øe, but could never feele any peace in it, becau≈øe it could never apply it to its own particular; but now being applyed by the help of the Spirit, it finds and feeles peace.</p>
               <p>Here then the Lord doth not any longer hold the ≈øoule in ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and doubting, by propounding unto it ≈øuch promi≈øes of hope, (as I may ≈øo call them) It may be yee ≈øhall bee hid in the day of wrath, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. but he ≈øpeaks full peace, as <hi>E≈øay</hi> 41.10. <hi>Feare not, for I am thy God; I will ≈øubdue your iniquities, and ca≈øt all your ≈øinnes behind my back, and I will remember them again≈øt you no more; I have received a reconciliation,</hi> Iob 33. <hi>Goe in peace.</hi> Here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith waxeth bold, and with a glad heart entertaineth the promi≈øe thus brought home unto it; the Apo≈øtle expre≈ø≈øeth this with a word very ≈øignificant, calling it an embracing of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. embracing implyes an affectionate receiving, with both armes opened, to ≈øhew an heart enlarged to tho≈øe that come unto us; and now the ≈øoule having thus embraced the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, and the Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt in the promi≈øe, and having him (like <hi>Simeon</hi>) in our armes, it layes him in the bo≈øome, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before gone forth to meet him, hee being now come, it brings him into the chamber of the heart, there to re≈øt, and abide for ever; now the ≈øoule po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth him as her own, re≈øts in him, and is ≈øatisfied with him, layes it ≈øelfe down in a holy re≈øt, after all its former troubles, pray≈øing God for his mercy as <hi>Simeon</hi> did when he had Chri≈øt in his armes, and committing it ≈øelfe for ever to that mercy and goodne≈ø≈øe which hath been thus revealed unto it.</p>
               <p>And thus the poor ≈øoul which hath been at emnity with God, comes by little and little to touch the top of the golden Scepter, and to enter into a Covenant of peace with the high God; now the hand is given to the Lord; as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ≈øpake 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. As God reacheth out to us the hand of Grace and of ≈øaving help; ≈øo doe wee give unto him the hand of faith, yeilding up our ≈øelves unto him, committing our ≈øelves unto him to bee kept by

               <p>And thus is this part of the Covenant made up betwixt God and us, and the ≈øoule now ≈øayes within it ≈øelfe, I that was ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an enemy, he hath now reconciled unto him≈øelfe; I that was in times pa≈øt without God, without Chri≈øt, without promi≈øe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Covenant, without hope, none of Gods people, not under mercy; yet now I have God for my God, Chri≈øt is my peace, in him I have obtained mercy, and am now become one of Gods people; the Covenant of his peace now belongs unto me, the Lord al≈øo is become my ≈øalvation; and here the ≈øoule re≈øts, and is ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, as with marrow and fatne≈ø≈øe; ≈øaying as <hi>Jacob, The Lord hath had mercy on me; therefore I have enough, I have all that my heart hath de≈øired, Gen.</hi> 33.11.</p>
               <p>Thus we ≈øee how faith clo≈øeth with the fir≈øt part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that God will be a God of mercy unto us, to ble≈ø≈øe us with ble≈ø≈øings of peace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the other part of it; wherein God offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe unto us to be a God over us, to rule us and govern us in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will, faith works the ≈øoule to a clo≈øing with this al≈øo.</p>
               <p>The converting ≈øinner, having ta≈øted the fruit of his own former wayes, and finding how bitter and evill it is that he hath ≈øinned, doth now de≈øire to re≈øign up him≈øelf to the Lords government, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deny his own will, and to take up the Lords yoke, and to be ≈øubject thereunto; he now ≈øayes no more, who is Lord over me, <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 12. He doth no longer look at him≈øelf as his own, to live to him≈øelf, after his own minde and will; but being weary of his own wayes, and finding it ≈øufficient (and too much) that he hath ≈øpent the time pa≈øt in the lu≈øts of the fle≈øh, now he commits him≈øelfe to the Lords government, taking him to be a God over him; to rule and order him in all his wayes: The Covenant which pa≈ø≈øeth betwixt God and us, is like that which pa≈ø≈øeth between a King and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the King promi≈øeth to rule and govern in mercy and in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe; and they againe promi≈øe to obey in loyalty and in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe; faith ≈øets up God upon his throne, and ≈øayes; Let the Lord reigne for ever and ever, reigne thou over mee, (O Lord) and lead me in the way which leads unto thee. And this doth faith work in us by the≈øe or the like meanes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith looks at the manner of Gods invitation and call, when
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:113533:145"/> he invites us to come and enter into Covenant with him; he doth not offer him≈øelfe to be a God to us to ble≈ø≈øe us, without being a God over us, to order and govern us, but links the≈øe two both together; If we will have his ble≈ø≈øing, his peace, we mu≈øt bee under his Dominion: Look as in a Common-wealth or Kingdom, none hath the benefit of the Law, but tho≈øe that ≈øubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to the Law: none have the protection of authority, but tho≈øe that obey it; ≈øo here; God doth not promi≈øe to pardon our ≈øins, leaving us ≈øtill at our own liberty to live as we li≈øt, but if he doe at all make a Covenant with us, he will be a God to us, as well to rule us, as to ≈øave us; To ≈øay, live as yee will, ≈øinne as yee will, and yet you ≈øhall be ≈øaved, is the Devils Covenant, not Gods; and therefore it is that when the Lord calls us into a Covenant with him≈øelfe, he bids us come out from among the wicked, ≈øeparate your ≈øelves, and touch no uncleane thing ≈øaith the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. and in this way he promi≈øes to receive us, and to be a God unto us; How vile ≈øoever we have been before time, it hinders us not from entring into Covenant with God, but if we will now become his people, we mu≈øt <hi>henceforth</hi> walke no more as we had wont to doe; we mu≈øt <hi>henceforth</hi> be ≈øeparate from our uncleanne≈ø≈øe, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.17. <hi>E≈øay</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>Come let us rea≈øon together, let us make an agreement, but withall wa≈øh you, make you clean, &amp;c.</hi> This is the Lords manner of invitation, ≈øo that faith ≈øees a nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to Gods authority, becau≈øe it may not take hold of one part of the Covenant without the other: If we will have God to bee our God to pardon us, and to ble≈ø≈øe us, wee mu≈øt have him a God over us to govern us after his own will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith opens the under≈øtanding, convincing us by arguments, how ju≈øt, how equall and rea≈øonable it is, that God ≈øhould rule and we obey; by faith we ≈øee the invi≈øible things of God, that is, his eternall power and Godhead, which before we ≈øaw not; by faith we ≈øee him in his Excellency and Maje≈øty, cloathed with glory and honour, riding upon the Heavens, attended upon with thou≈øand thou≈øands of Angels mini≈øtring unto him: By faith we ≈øee him moderating the whole world by his wi≈ødome and power, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 103. We look at him as King of Kings, as Prince of all the Rulers of the earth; Neither doe we by faith thus ≈øee God, as he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, but as he is to us, as having power in his hand either to ≈øave
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:113533:146"/> or de≈øtroy; ≈øo that there is no re≈øi≈øting; we know now that if we fall upon that ≈øtone, by our rebellion, it will grinde us to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; now there is no more que≈øtion made, who ≈øhall have the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, though in times pa≈øt we had ≈øaid, this man ≈øhall not reign over us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. yet now it is our chiefe de≈øire, that his Kindome may come into us and beare ≈øway in us; Faith ≈øets before us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo the benefits and kindne≈ø≈øe of God towards us, and ≈øo per≈øwades us by tho≈øe mercies of God to give up our ≈øelves as a ≈øacrifice in humble obedience unto his will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. Faith rea≈øoneth in the heart as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I will pray≈øe thee O Lord with my whole heart; yea, I will glorifie thy name for ever, for great is thy mercy towards me, thou ha≈øt delivered my ≈øoule from the lowe≈øt grave, P≈øal.</hi> 86.12, 13. Faith makes us ≈øpeak to God as the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> did to <hi>Gideon,</hi> when he had delivered them out of the hand of the <hi>Midianites, Come</hi> (≈øay they) <hi>unto him, and reign over us, both thou and thy ≈øon, for thou ha≈øt delivered us out of the hand of</hi> Midian, Iudg. 8.22. <hi>Now God is counted worthy of all honour and ≈øervice,</hi> Apoc. 4.7. &amp; 5.12.13. Worthy to be exalted and glorified; thus faith urgeth it as a thing mo≈øt rea≈øonable, that God ≈øo glorious in him≈øelfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power over us, to ≈øave or de≈øtroy, and when he might have de≈øtroyed us, yet hath ≈øaved us from ≈øo great a death, and prepared for us ≈øo great ≈øalvation, ≈øhould be glorified by us, wee ≈øubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ≈øelves unto the obedience of his will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith makes us look at the Lords government as a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full goverment, bringing peace and ble≈ø≈øing unto tho≈øe that are under it; it looks at this King of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> as a mercifull King, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. It counts tho≈øe ≈øubjects happy that are free of this Kingdome, and tho≈øe ≈øervants happy that ≈øtand before this King, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. It makes the ≈øoule lament its bondage under other Lords; as in <hi>E≈øay</hi> 26.13. Lord (≈øaith the Church there) other Lords be≈øides thee, have ruled over us, but in thee is our onely hope; having felt the mi≈øery of tho≈øe former ≈ølaveries in which it hath been holden, having been in the Iron Furnace of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ≈øate by the waters of <hi>Babel,</hi> and wept there, having been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øuch cruell Lords, now they are weary of the yoke of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øor; and now the ble≈ø≈øing of the Lords government, the Laws of God which were before counted as cords and bands, fitter for bond≈ølaves then for free-men, are now e≈øteemed holy, and ju≈øt,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:113533:146"/> and good <hi>Rom</hi> 7. Faith believes that which the Lord hath ≈øaid, that he hath given us his Commandements <hi>for our good,</hi> that it may goe well with us for ever, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith reconciles the heart unto God, it doth not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is reconciled unto us, but al≈øo reconciles us unto God, whereas before we hated him, and would none of him, and thru≈øt him away from us, as the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> did <hi>Mo≈øes, Acts</hi> 7.27. Yet now the ≈øoule having by faith believed his goodne≈ø≈øe towards us, is thereby reconciled unto him, it layes down all weapons of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ≈øubmits in love. Like as a Traytor having found the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favour of his Prince, in pardoning his treacherous practi≈øes, his naughty heart which was before ≈øo full of treachery, is now overcome with this unde≈øerved favour; ≈øo we al≈øo, having been in times pa≈øt rebels again≈øt God, haters of him, enemies unto him, having had our mindes ≈øet upon evill things, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. are now over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his goodne≈ø≈øe towards us, our heart is turned to him, our hatred is turned into love, faith working love cau≈øing us to love him, for that great love wherewith hee hath loved us in Chri≈øt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. So that now we come to God, as they did to <hi>David,</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.18. Thine are we, we are wholly thine: And thus faith ≈ølayes the hatred, and puls down the partition wall which was betwixt God us, reconciles the enmity, and makes of two one, working peace and love; ≈øo that now the believing ≈øoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires nothing more then to bee ≈øubject to his government; and grieves when it is hindred, that it cannot doe that which he hath commanded: And thus the Covenant is made up in both parts of it, offered unto us by God, and received of us by faith, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.34.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As faith clo≈øeth with the Covenant, and brings us into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; ≈øo it doth al≈øo act and work in us, to enable us to walk with God according to the Covenant which we have made with him; there is a keeping of Covenant required of us, as well as a making of Covenant with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 7, 9. in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 50.5. the Saints are ≈øaid to <hi>make</hi> a Covenant with God; but in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 103.18. they are ≈øaid to <hi>keep</hi> his Covenant; ≈øo there is both a making, and a keeping of Covenant; and both the≈øe are done by faith; faith doth fir≈øt enter us into Covenant with God (as we have ≈øeen above) and then by the ≈øame faith we are carried on to a keeping of the Covenant made; and that according to both parts of the Covenant, before laid down.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:113533:147"/>1. Whereas God enters into Covenant with us, to heale our back-≈ølidings, to ble≈ø≈øe us with all kinds of ble≈ø≈øings convenient for us; Now the work of faith is to carry on the ≈øoule in a continuall dependence upon God for all the good which he hath promi≈øed; If we be in danger, faith looks unto God for ≈øafety and deliverance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.25. It believes the promi≈øes of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and depends upon them; If we have ≈øinned, and done the things wee ≈øhould not, faith brings the ≈øoule back unto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in a way of repentance; and looks to the faithfulne≈ø≈øe and ≈øtability of his Covenant; hoping ≈øtill to finde mercy, and forgivene≈ø≈øe with him, albeit we have ≈øinned again≈øt him; and ≈øo in all other occa≈øions which befall us in this life, according as any evill pre≈ø≈øeth upon us, or any ble≈ø≈øing is wanting unto us, faith hath recour≈øe to the promi≈øe and Covenant of God; waiting upon him for all that mercy which we ≈øtand in need of in every kind: And when we doe thus put forth our faith in the exerci≈øe and acts of it, depending by it upon God in all our occa≈øions, this is the life of faith, which the Scripture ≈øpeaks of, this is to live by faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. and to walk by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>And this life of faith is then e≈øpecially ≈øeen, when the cour≈øe of Gods providence and dealing with us ≈øeemes to make again≈øt his promi≈øe; herein the life of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was ≈øeen; that though his body grew more impotent, and dead every yeare, yet God having promi≈øed him a Son, <hi>Abraham</hi> believes even above hope; notwith≈øtanding the deadne≈ø≈øe of his body, and of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb. And ≈øo <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> God having promi≈øed good to <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> though for the pre≈øent he ≈øaw nothing but wants and nece≈ø≈øities and mortality among the people, ≈øo many thou≈øands dying in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈ø≈øe; yet was he ≈øo confident of Gods goodne≈ø≈øe towards that people, that he was bold to promi≈øe good to <hi>Jethro</hi> his Father-in-Law, in ca≈øe he would joyn him≈øelfe unto them, and be one of them, <hi>Come with us</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> unto him) <hi>and we will doe thee good, for God hath promi≈øed good unto I≈ørael, Num.</hi> 10.29. When <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> promi≈øed to doe him good, hee might have ≈øaid, You may bring me to ≈øorrow, and mi≈øery enough, here you are in a mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wilderne≈ø≈øe where you ≈øometimes want water and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat; and here you die, and your carka≈øes fall in the Wilderne≈ø≈øe; what good can I expect that you can doe for mee?
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:113533:147"/> and yet <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> by the power of faith, is confident to promi≈øe him good. God (≈øaith he) hath promi≈øed good unto <hi>I≈ørael. Mo≈øes</hi> looks beyond the pre≈øent workes of Gods providence, and con≈øiders the ≈øtability of Gods promi≈øe, and that doth he re≈øt upon; God not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as man that he ≈øhould lye or repent, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. therefore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> concludes. Let the Lord for the pre≈øent doe as he will; let all things ≈øeem to cro≈ø≈øe his promi≈øe never ≈øo much, yet this I am ≈øure of, God hath promi≈øed good to <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and therefore good ≈øhall come; and thus doth faith enable the ≈øoule to walke in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, depending upon him for that mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe which he hath promi≈øed. God ≈øaith, I will be a God unto thee to ble≈ø≈øe thee, and to doe thee good; and this I require of thee, that thou tru≈øt to me, and depend upon me for all the good thou ≈øtande≈øt in need of; and faith doth ≈øo, it re≈øts upon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe. And thus faith fulfills this part of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the other part of the Covenant, <hi>(I will be a God over thee, and thou ≈øhalt glorifie me,)</hi> to this faith a≈ø≈øents al≈øo, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us on in an an≈øwerable conver≈øation, thereby te≈øtifying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world, that we have ≈øet up the Lord to be our God, to command us, and to rule us, and that we have given up our ≈øelves to be his people; And here are ≈øundry acts of faith by which it inables us ≈øo to walk. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith hath alwayes an eye to the rule and command of God which he hath ≈øet before us to walke by, it attends con≈øtantly to the Tables of the Covenant; in things to be beleived it looks to the promi≈øe; and in things to be practi≈øed it looks to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. As in matters of faith it will beleeve nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a word of faith to re≈øt it ≈øelf upon; ≈øo in matters of fact, it will doe nothing without a word to command or warrant that which is done, becau≈øe without a word it cannot be done in faith, and it is no act of faith which is not done in faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. Faith will pre≈øent no ≈øtrange fire before the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. It is inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitive to under≈øtand what the will of the Lord is, as knowing that he accepts nothing but what is according to his own will and word; therefore it is that <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Teach me good judgement and knowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:113533:148"/> faith will be circum≈øpect and fearfull, till it ≈øee a word to direct and warrant its way; but when it ≈øees a plain word, then it growes bold and confident as knowing that this way is right. This then is the worke of faith, to attend to the word of faith in every thing; if we be to perform any act of wor≈øhip unto God, it will wor≈øhip him not after the traditions and precepts of men, but after the will of God; if we bee to perform any office of love, mercy, or ju≈øtice towards men, it hath an eye to the word in all the≈øe, to doe every thing according to the pattern ≈øet down in the word; to walk without a word to direct us by, is the work of unbeliefe not of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Faith takes direction from the true rule, ≈øo it directs us to the right end, it lifts us up above our ≈øelves, and above our owne ends and aimes, making God our highe≈øt and chiefe≈øt end, for which we live and work, as we are of him, and live in him and by him, ≈øo by faith we live to him and for him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p>Rea≈øon tells us we mu≈øt be for our ≈øelves, but faith tells us we mu≈øt be for God; this God claimes as his right and due, and faith al≈øo a≈ø≈øents unto; God faith, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt glorifie me, P≈øal.</hi> 50.15.

               <p n="4">4. Faith incourages us unto well doing, by per≈øwading us that our ≈øervices are accepted of God in Chri≈øt; and by propounding unto us the promi≈øes of reward.</p>

And this is no ≈ømall incouragement to well doing, when we believe what we doe ≈øhall be accepted graciou≈øly. What will not a ≈øubject do, if he know his King will take in good part the ≈øervice which is tendred unto him? ≈øometimes they run them≈øelves out of all to humour them: Now faith a≈ø≈øures us that there is not one prayer, one holy de≈øire, one good thought, or word, or good purpo≈øe which is thought or ≈øpoken or done to the glory of God, but God takes notice of it and accepts it in good part, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16.</p>

               <p>Secondly, a power a≈ø≈øi≈øting and being with us.</p>
               <p>By faith we get a power of grace inherent and abiding in us, and that is in this manner, and by the≈øe meanes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By faith we look at Chri≈øt as having all fulne≈ø≈øe of grace in him≈øelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. All others (Angels or Saints) have but their mea≈øure, ≈øome more, ≈øome le≈ø≈øe, according to the mea≈øure of the gift of Chri≈øt, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.7. but Chri≈øt hath received the ≈øpirit not by mea≈øure but in the fulne≈ø≈øe of it, <hi>John</hi> 3.34. Faith looks at this fulne≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By faith we know that what ever fulne≈ø≈øe of grace is in Chri≈øt, he hath received it not for him≈øelfe only, but for us, that he might communicate unto us, and we might receive from him; In <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 68.18. it is ≈øaid, <hi>He received gifts for men;</hi> not for him≈øelf, but for men, that we might receive from him; and thence it is that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulne≈ø≈øe we receive grace for grace;</hi> his wi≈øedome is to make us wi≈øe; his meekne≈ø≈øe and patience, to make us meek and patient, and ≈øo in the re≈øt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By faith we look at Chri≈øt as faithfull to di≈øtribute unto us all ≈øuch grace as he hath received for us; he is faithfull in all the hou≈øe of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. faithfull in di≈øpen≈øing all the trea≈øure of grace committed unto him for his Churches good; he keeps no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing backe, his faithfulne≈ø≈øe will not ≈øuffer him to keep that to him≈øelfe which he hath received for us; but as he hath received all for us, ≈øo in faithfulne≈ø≈øe he will communicate the ≈øame unto us according to our need; and therefore it is that as in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 68. he is ≈øaid to receive gifts for men, ≈øo in <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4. The Apo≈øtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the ≈øame place of the P≈øalme, he changeth the word <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> into <hi>giving,</hi> and ≈øaith, <hi>He gave gifts unto men;</hi> as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:113533:149"/> ≈øo hee gives, being faithfull in all that is committed to him; and this faithfulne≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt, doth faith look at, that we may receive grace from him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith looks at the promi≈øe of Chri≈øt, promi≈øing to give us his ≈øpirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. upon him re≈øts a ≈øpirit of ≈øtrength, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 11.2. and he hath promi≈øed, that the holy Gho≈øt ≈øhall take of his, and ≈øhall give unto us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. and that the father ≈øhall give the holy Gho≈øt unto tho≈øe that de≈øire him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. the≈øe prom≈øes faith feeds upon, and ≈øucks life and ≈øpirit out of them, begging performance of them according to our need. Doe we want wi≈ødome, meekne≈ø≈øe, patience, or any other grace? faith carries us by prayer to this fountaine, and in this way waits for, and expects to receive the grace we want; as the childe by ≈øucking the brea≈øt, draws forth milk for its own nouri≈øhment, and thereby grows in ≈øtrength, ≈øo doe we by the prayer of faith ≈øuck from the promi≈øe of grace, and doe thereby derive ≈øtrength to our inward man to enable us unto all wel-doing: And thus it is, that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. we are ≈øaid to receive the promi≈øe of the ≈øpirit by faith, which ≈øpirit being a ≈øpirit of power, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. and being thus received by faith, we ≈øee how faith enables us with all power to fulfill the Covenant which we have made with God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith gets an a≈ø≈øi≈øting ≈øtrength from Chri≈øt; Be≈øides that which is inherent, dwelling within us, there is an a≈ø≈øi≈øting power of Chri≈øt, by which he helps his ≈øervants that ca≈øt them≈øelves upon his help; In tho≈øe great works which were done by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles, it was not any indwelling power within them≈øelves, by which they did them, but a power of God without them, a≈ø≈øi≈øting and working with them; and ≈øo it is (after a ≈øort) in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary duties we take in hand. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.26. In carrying the Ark God helped the Levites which were to beare it, the Lord a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted them; and this doth the Apo≈øtle al≈øo ≈øeeme to point unto, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. ≈øpeaking of his aboundant labour in the Go≈øpel, hee ≈øaith, <hi>yet it is not I, but the grace of God which is with me;</hi> he doth not ≈øay, which is <hi>in me,</hi> though there was ≈øuch grace within him al≈øo; but which is <hi>with me,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:113533:150"/> re≈øi≈øt Sathan by faith; but in the other place, <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that it is God which treads Sathan under our feet; both the≈øe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together imply thus much, that the faith within us, mu≈øt bee working in re≈øi≈øtng of Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>han; but yet the power by which we overcome him, is not by the power of faith or any grace in us alone; but the a≈ø≈øi≈øting power of God without us, is that which ≈øubdues Sathan to us, and treads him under our feet. This a≈ø≈øi≈øting power the Lord hath promi≈øed to his people, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.9, 10. And faith re≈øts upon the≈øe promi≈øes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. and this makes all things po≈ø≈øible to a believer, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.23. becau≈øe faith ≈øets Gods own power awork, to work that by us which of our ≈øelves we could never doe; he works all our works for us, while we re≈øt upon him for help, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 26.12. Thus faith furni≈øheth us with all ≈øtrength, enabling us to walk with God in a holy conver≈øation, according to the tenour of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As faith doth thus ≈øtrengthen us, &amp;c. ≈øo if at any time wee be by occa≈øion over taken with any fault; faith recovers us out of our falls, and re≈øtores us againe to our former e≈øtate; the true believer though he doth not deale fal≈øely with God in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 44.17. yet he may and ≈øometimes doth walk weakly in the keeping of it, becau≈øe he doth not ≈øtirre up his faith, in which his ≈øtrength lyeth; though his heart is not turned back, yet his foot may ≈øometimes goe out of the path; many ≈ølips Gods own covenanted people are ≈øubject unto: But though they fall and fall often, yet they do not ≈øo fall, but they ri≈øe againe; they turn a≈øide, but yet they return again into the way of the Covenant; faith brings us back to God in exerci≈øes of humiliation, and renewing of our repentance before him; It ca≈øts ≈øhame upon our faces, that after all the grace which hath been ≈øhewed unto us, we ≈øhould ≈øo requite the Lord, with ≈øuch undutifull carriages, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>Ezrah</hi> 9.6. But yet it doth withall encourage us with hope, ≈øpeaking thus in the heart of a believer, yet there is hope in <hi>I≈ørael</hi> for all this, <hi>Ezrah</hi> 10.3. It remindes us of tho≈øe promi≈øes, <hi>Return unto mee, and I will return unto you, Zach.</hi> 1. <hi>Ye have indeed ≈øinned a great ≈øinne, ye have done all this wickedne≈ø≈øe; but yet depart not from following the Lord; for the Lord will not for≈øake his people, whom he hath plea≈øed to make his people,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20, 21, 22. By the≈øe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:113533:150"/> and ≈øuch other promi≈øes, faith encourageth us to return unto our God, taking words unto our ≈øelves and pleading the Covenant of his grace towards us, intreating him to receive us graciou≈øly, <hi>Ho≈øeah</hi> 14. This work of faith brought <hi>Peter</hi> back to Chri≈øt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ≈øhamefull denyall of him, it made him to lament his ≈øinne, and to look up unto him for grace and forgivene≈ø≈øe, whereas <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> wanting this faith, lies down in de≈øperate ≈øorrow, never able to ri≈øe up nor recover him≈øelfe any more.</p>
               <p>And thus we ≈øee how faith doth act, both in bringing us into Covenant with God, and helps us al≈øo to walk in Covenant with him.</p>
               <p>And thus we have ≈øhewed; fir≈øt, That faith is the condition of the Covenant; ≈øecondly, Why faith is appointed to be the condition rather then works; thirdly, It is the act, not the habit which is the condition on our parts; fourthly, What tho≈øe acts of faith be, by which it brings us into Covenant, and inables us to walk in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Que≈øt.</hi> But here a further que≈øtion is made by ≈øome, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of condition faith is; It's granted (will ≈øome ≈øay) that faith is a condition, but it is a condition only con≈øequent to our Iu≈øtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ≈øo to our being in Covenant with God; but its no antecedent condition; wee are (as they conceive) in a ≈øtate of Grace and ≈øalvation before faith and then faith comes and believes that Iu≈øtification and ≈øalvation which was before given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> This is ≈øome of that new light which the old age of the Church hath brought forth; which what it tends unto, I know not, unle≈ø≈øe it be to this that a man ≈øhould not look at any habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace in him≈øelfe, whether ≈øanctification or faith, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in as much as the≈øe availe nothing (according to them) to a mans Iu≈øtification, ≈øeeing wee are Iu≈øtified before faith: They would have a man to ≈øee nothing in him≈øelfe, becau≈øe (as they think) the Grace which is ≈øeene is temporall; the Grace which is not ≈øeen is eternall; though a man knows that he hath faith, yet (≈øay they) he is not thereby ju≈øtified, nor brought into the e≈øtate of grace, but is ju≈øtified before faith; therefore never look at this or that in your ≈øelves, all the≈øe are nothing to your Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtification, or ≈øalvation: This (as I think) is the end of this opinion.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:113533:151"/>
               <p>In oppo≈øition whereunto, I lay down this conclu≈øion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, That we are not actually ju≈øtified, nor in a ≈øtate of grace and ≈øalvation, before faith, before we believe; This I hope to prove by evidence of the word; only before I come to the proof of it, to prevent mi≈øtake, ob≈øerve how I ≈øpeak of actuall Iu≈øtification, whereas our Iu≈øtification may be con≈øidered either, Fir≈øt, as purpo≈øed and determnied in the minde and will of God; Or ≈øecondly, as impetrated and obtained for us by the obedience of Chri≈øt; Or thirdly, as actually applyed unto us, ≈øo as we may be truely ≈øaid to be actually ju≈øt in the ≈øight of God; in the two former re≈øpects it is not denyed; God purpo≈øed to ju≈øtifie us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, and therefore much more before our faith; And that atonement and obedience which Chri≈øt hath performed for us, is al≈øo before our faith, and before we were born.</p>
               <p>But the que≈øtion is whether this Righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe wrought for us by Chri≈øt, bee actually applyed to a ≈øinner before hee believe; whether one, as yet not believing, bee actually acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his ≈øinne and accounted ju≈øt and righteous before God.</p>
               <p>And this is that which I am now to prove, again≈øt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of the former opinion; <hi>≈øc.</hi> that we are not actually ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before faith; Its not a condition only con≈øequent, but ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to our actuall ju≈øtification, and being in ≈øtate of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rea≈ø.</hi> 1. To make our ju≈øtification goe before faith, is to place our ju≈øtification before our vocation and calling, and ≈øo inverts the order ob≈øerved by the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. who placeth our calling before our ju≈øtification, and if our calling be before our ju≈øtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then is our faith al≈øo before it; becau≈øe we are not called effectually (of which kinde of calling we now ≈øpeak, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle doth) untill we believe; faith therefore being comprehended in our calling, and calling being before ju≈øtification, faith al≈øo of nece≈ø≈øity mu≈øt goe before our ju≈øtification.</p>

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:113533:151"/> whom this righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe comes, that they may be ju≈øtified by it, and that is, upon tho≈øe that doe believe; thirdly, The meanes by which it comes to be upon them, and that is by faith, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe of God is by faith on them that doe believe; ju≈øtification is here limited to them that doe believe, not extended to them that believe not; and lea≈øt any ≈øhould evade by ≈øaying that they are called believers in regard of Gods pre≈øcience and foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; not in re≈øpect of any pre≈øent habit of faith, actually dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, (in which ≈øence ≈øome are called ≈øheep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16.) therefore to prevent this eva≈øion, the Apo≈øtle addes the meanes by which they come to have this righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of God upon them, which is by faith; though it had been enough to have ≈øaid that it was upon them that believe; yet to put this matter out of doubt, he addes tho≈øe words, that it is by faith; And if it bee by faith, then not before faith; but if it is by faith, as the Apo≈øtle affirmes, therefore not before faith; If faith were a condition con≈øequent to our ju≈øtification, not antecedent, it could not bee ≈øaid to be by faith. In <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 50.15. The Lord puts a double condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning our deliverance out of trouble, one antecedent <hi>(call upon me)</hi> another con≈øequent <hi>(and thou ≈øhalt glorifie me,)</hi> in the mid≈øt of which two, ≈øtands the deliverance promi≈øed; ≈øo as the order is; fir≈øt, we mu≈øt call; ≈øecondly, then God delivers; and then thirdly, we mu≈øt glorifie him; now if our faith were a condition only con≈øequent to our ju≈øtification, then it ≈øtands in no other place in re≈øpect of ju≈øtification, then doth our glorifying of God, which followes our deliverance out of trouble; and it ≈øo, then we may as well be ≈øaid to be delivered by our glorifying of God, which follows our deliverance, as to bee ju≈øtified by faith, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes our ju≈øtification.</p>

               <p>Some have beene of minde, that the promi≈øes which we call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall are not free promi≈øes, or promi≈øes of free grace, and therefore they make an oppo≈øition betwixt the promi≈øes which are called ab≈øolute and the conditionall, as if only the ab≈øolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes were free promi≈øes, excluding the conditionall; but the condition annexed (being a condition of the Go≈øpel, not of the Law) doth no more derogate from the freene≈ø≈øe of grace, then a Princes offering a royall reward to a Subject upon condition that he doe thankfully accept of it, and acknowledge his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounty towards him, doth any whit derogate from the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the gift; no more doth the condition of faith, by which we receive the grace given unto us of God, derogate from the freene≈ø≈øe of his grace towards us; a legall condition doth indeed exclude free grace; but an Evangelicall condition doth not; When the Lord ≈øaith, <hi>Believe and thou ≈øhalt bee ≈øaved, Act.</hi> 16.31. and ≈øaith al≈øo, <hi>by grace yee are ≈øaved, Eph.</hi> 2.8.

               <p>Secondly, The≈øe conditionall promi≈øes are promi≈øes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and therefore al≈øo promi≈øes of free grace; either the≈øe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes are promi≈øes of free grace, or el≈øe the Go≈øpel is not a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of free grace: It is the Go≈øpel only, and not the Law, which ≈øaith, <hi>Believe and be ≈øaved:</hi> The Law never made promi≈øe of ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, upon ≈øuch a condition; If then the≈øe conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, bee promi≈øes of the Go≈øpel, then they are promi≈øes of free Grace, or el≈øe the Go≈øpel is not a Doctrine of free Grace.</p>

Thus then the Go≈øpel being a law of faith, di≈øtingui≈øhed again≈øt the law of works, the commandement to believe cannot belong to the law of works, but to the Go≈øpel, which is the law of Grace: And hereto agrees that al≈øo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. with ver≈øe 5. where <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Apo≈øtle≈øhip, and being put apart to preach (not the law, but) the Go≈øpel of God, he ≈øhews the end of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that obedience might be given unto the faith, that is, that the Doctrine of Faith being made known, and the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Faith publi≈øhed, men might be brought to ≈øubmit to that Doctrine of Faith revealed.

               <p>Papi≈øts turn the Covenant of grace into a Covenant of works: This doth the contrary, turning the Covenant of works into a Covenant of grace; <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ≈øpeaking of the point of ju≈øtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, brings in <hi>Andradius</hi> his conceit, which is this, That <hi>utraque ju≈øtitia, &amp; Legis &amp; Fidei, &amp;c.</hi> both righteou≈øne≈ø≈øes, both the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the Law, and the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of Faith, doth con≈øi≈øt in <hi>ob≈øervatione Legis,</hi> in the ob≈øervation of the Law; only with this difference, that when the Law is fulfilled by the unregenerate, then it is <hi>ju≈øtitia Legis,</hi> the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the Law; when by the regenerate, then it is <hi>ju≈øtitia Fidei,</hi> the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of Faith. Like hereto is this Doctrine, that the commandement of faith is a commandement of the Law, for then both Covenants, both Law and Go≈øpel, mu≈øt ≈øtand in <hi>ob≈øervatione fidei,</hi> in the duty of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; only perhaps the maintainers of this opinion will make a difference thus, That that faith which is wrought by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, is the faith of the law or Covenant of works, and that faith which is wrought by the promi≈øe, is the faith of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: But as he, notwith≈øtanding his di≈øtinction of men regenerate and unregenerate, doth in effect confound both Covenants, changing the Covenant of grace into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works: So doe the≈øe, notwith≈øtanding their di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of commandement and promi≈øe; they confound both Covenants, changing the Covenant of works (which ≈øtands in doing) into a Covenant of grace, (which ≈øtands in believing) and ≈øo by this Doctrine one of the principall differences betwixt the two Covenants, is taken away, the one requiring works, the other faith, the one doing, the other believing.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This is confirmed further by that which is ≈øpoken of our Saviour Chri≈øt in <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.14, 15. where it is ≈øaid of him, that he came preaching the Go≈øpel, (not the Law, but the Go≈øpel)
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:113533:157"/> and ≈øaying, <hi>Repent and believe the Go≈øpel;</hi> here the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believe, is directly called a preaching of the Go≈øpel, and therefore it is a commandement of the Go≈øpel, and not of the Law.</p>
               <p>Other Rea≈øons might be added, as namely, if faith be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the law, then a man may be ≈øaved by a work of the Law, and cannot be ≈øaved without it; Secondly, That this opinion makes the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the law, and the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of faith to be all one, if faith be a duty of the law, &amp;c. Thirdly, What the law commands it commands it as a work; but faith is not requird as a work, being everywhere in the Go≈øpel oppo≈øed to working; But the≈øe I pa≈ø≈øe by, the other may ≈øuffice.</p>
               <p>Thus farre then we are come, that the putting of faith as a condition of life in the Covenant of grace, doth no whit derogate from the freene≈ø≈øe of grace.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe the gift of faith flows from the ≈øame purpo≈øe of grace towards us, as life it ≈øelfe doth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becau≈øe faith is an Evangelicall grace of the Go≈øpel, not of the Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I adde this al≈øo, that it derogates nothing from grace, becau≈øe faith receives all the ble≈ø≈øings of ≈øalvation promi≈øed, only from the hand of grace alone; we acknowledge no ≈øuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as by which we might receive life from the hand of ju≈øtice, as putting a price into our hand to be a meritorious cau≈øe of life; ≈øuch a condition could not indeed ≈øtand with grace; but the condition we put, is both received by grace, is by grace wrought in us, and doth al≈øo receive all from grace, and therefore doth nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the grace of the Covenant: The Apo≈øtle cleares this, in that one ≈øhort ≈øpeech of his in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>ye are ≈øaved by grace through faith:</hi> There is fir≈øt the maine ble≈ø≈øing of the Covenant, <hi>yee are ≈øaved;</hi> There is ≈øecondly, the fountaine or cau≈øe of it, <hi>(by grace) yee are ≈øaved by grace;</hi> Then thirdly, there is the condition <hi>(through faith:)</hi> And if any ≈øhould now ask how it could be by grace, and yet depend upon the condition of faith, the Apo≈øtle goes on and ≈øhews how that may be; namely, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe faith is not of our ≈øelves, but it is the gift of God; and 2. Becau≈øe faith doth not come to God boa≈øtingly, to claime life by the works of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, which we have done;
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:113533:158"/> but comes to him with an empty hand to receive what grace and mercy is willing to give; ≈øuch a condition as this, doth no more derogate from the freene≈ø≈øe of grace, then doth the beggers receiving of the almes given him, derogate from the kindne≈ø≈øe of him that gave it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The grace of the Covenant is free notwith≈øtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, becau≈øe we doe not put any condition as antecedent to the Covenant on Gods part, whereby to induce and move the Lord to enter into Covenant with us, as if there were any thing ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed in us, which might invite and draw him to take us into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him≈øelfe; only we ≈øuppo≈øe a condition antecedent to the promi≈øe of life, which condition we are to ob≈øerve and walk in; and in the ob≈øervation thereof to expect the ble≈ø≈øing of life which the Covenant promi≈øeth: If God had not purpo≈øed to have dealt with us after his rich grace, he might have ≈øaid to us (when he ≈øaw us polluted in our bloud,) <hi>I will no more have mercy,</hi> as it is in <hi>Ho≈øeah</hi> 1.6, 9. <hi>ye ≈øhall no more be my people, neither will I be yours:</hi> But yet he is plea≈øed to over-look all our ≈øinfull pollutions, and to ≈øprinkle clean water upon us, and then to take us by the hand and to enter into Covenant with us: here is grace free, notwith≈øtanding the condition of faith to which the promi≈øe is made.</p>
               <p>In a word, The Lord out of his free grace purpo≈øing life and ≈øalvation to his cho≈øen, then to make way for the accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his purpo≈øe in bringing us to life, fir≈øt, he works in us renewing grace, and puts within us a ≈øpirit of faith, and ≈øo leads us on in the way of faith, to the obtaining of that great ble≈ø≈øing, the ≈øalvation promi≈øed; the one of the≈øe being antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and as a condition to the other.</p>

               <p>And for this end take the≈øe few directions</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we will honour God and exalt him in due manner, we mu≈øt ≈øet him up as our cheife and highe≈øt in our e≈øteem, far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every name that is named in this world, or that which is to come; ≈øet none compar with him, none equall unto him; Kings count them≈øelves not to be honoured with due honour, if they be not ≈øet up above other men: Its not enough to honour God, but we mu≈øt honour him as God, and that is to ≈øet him highe≈øt in our hearts, and above all: Hence it is that the Saints of God have u≈øed ≈øuch expre≈ø≈øions concerning him, as doe ≈øingle him forth beyond the compari≈øon of all creatures: Thus <hi>Mo≈øes, Who is like unto thee among≈øt the Gods? who is like unto thee, ≈øo glorious in holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. So <hi>David, Thou art great, O Lord, there is none like thee,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.22.

So <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, which pa≈ø≈øe≈øt by the trangre≈ø≈øions of the remnant of thine heritage?</hi> Thus have the Saints advanced God, in their e≈øteem of him, making none like unto him in greatne≈ø≈øe, in glory, in holine≈ø≈øe, in goodne≈ø≈øe, and in mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus we mu≈øt ri≈øe up in our thoughts and apprehen≈øions of God, till we come to a holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtacy
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:113533:163"/> and admiration of him, carried beyond the limits of all created excellency, ≈øo as to e≈øteeme all things el≈øe as nothing in compari≈øon of him, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 40. There be men that ≈øay they are gods, and think they are equall with the mo≈øt High, but they are but gods of the earth as the Prophet calls them, (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.11.) but our God is the God of heaven; therefore ≈øet him on high above all gods; God counts him≈øelfe deba≈øed when any are made equall unto him, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 46.5, 9.</p>

               <p n="3">3. We mu≈øt count the things of God the greate≈øt things, his work to be the greate≈øt work, his ≈øervice the greate≈øt bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of our whole life; yea, to be preferred before life it ≈øelfe. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was in hand with that great work of God, the re-edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and the reformation of things ami≈ø≈øe in Church

               <p>The men of the world look at their own things as the great things which they mu≈øt attend unto; the things of God, are with them, things of le≈ø≈øe value; they preferre their own things before the things of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; But tho≈øe that are the Lords people mu≈øt remember that they have given them≈øelves unto the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. ≈øo as they are not their own any more, but the Lords, and to be for them≈øelves no further then may ≈øtand with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, no further to ≈øeek their own things then may be <hi>for</hi> the Lord, and not <hi>again≈øt</hi> the Lord.

               <p n="4">4. If we will honour God as his people ≈øhould doe, we mu≈øt ≈øtand for his honour in times of generall declining; when all ≈øeeme to neglect him, and lay his honour in the du≈øt: When People, Nations, and Languages, ≈øhall fall down and wor≈øhip the golden Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> the King ≈øets up, then to de≈øpi≈øe

               <p n="5">5. If we will exalt God, we mu≈øt re≈øt upon his help at dead lifts, when all other helps faile us, in greate≈øt ≈øtraits, when we know not which way to turn us, when we ≈øee no help either in heaven or earth, but in him alone; Herein <hi>Jeho≈øhaphat</hi> gave glory to God, when he knew not what to doe, then were his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. Thus the three Children, when ca≈øt into the fiery Furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> when thrown into the Lyons Den, yet then they believed that the God whom the ≈øerved, was able to deliver them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. And thus <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> honoured God at the Red Sea, when all was de≈øperate in the eye of fle≈øh and blood; yet <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> by the power of faith then believed a deliverance ≈øhould come, <hi>Stand ≈øtill</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>and ≈øee the ≈øalvation of God;</hi> God is greatly honoured by us, when we tru≈øt upon him in ≈øuch de≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate times.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If we will honour God, we mu≈øt be exceeding carefull to keep our vowes and promi≈øes, which we have made unto him; walk circum≈øpectly according to the Covenant we have entred into: We ≈øee how the Lord ≈øometimes blames <hi>I≈ørael</hi> for de≈øpi≈øing his Covenant which they had made with him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.59. we cannot neglect our Covenant with him, but it will argue a neglect of God him≈øelfe; <hi>Thou ha≈øt de≈øpi≈øed me,</hi> ≈øaith the Lord to <hi>David,</hi> when he had de≈øpi≈øed the Commandement which he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to ob≈øerve, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 9.10.</p>

Be ≈øure the Lord will require the promi≈øes we have made unto him. Ha≈øt thou then opened thy mouth unto the Lord? know thou can≈øt not goe back, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. Thou can≈øt not neglect thy promi≈øe to God, without a neglect of God him≈øelfe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If we will honour God, we mu≈øt lie under the authority of every <hi>word</hi> of his, and conforme our ≈øelves to his example, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to become followers of him, in imitating the vertues of God which hee hath ≈øet before us to walk by: Its a part of that honour which children owe to their parents, to obey their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to imitate their godly example in well doing; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not honour God more, then when we are humbled at his feet, to receive his word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3. ≈øuffering his word to rule in our hearts, ≈øo as we dare not goe again≈øt it in any thing, trembling to ≈øinne again≈øt it, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 66. and when we renounce the manners of the world, ≈øeeking to become followers of God as deare children, this is to ≈øet him up as honoured by us, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 5.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is a free Covenant, a Covenant of free grace, freely made with us, and freely communicating to us all the ble≈ø≈øings promi≈øed in it: The ble≈ø≈øings made over to us in this Covenant, doe ≈øpring from nothing in us, but only from grace in God.</p>
               <p>Gods Covenant is not like Covenants which are u≈øually made among men, in which each party expects ≈øome benefit from the other; <hi>Abimelech</hi> thought it good to make a Covenant of peace with <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> becau≈øe hee ≈øaw God was with him; If <hi>I≈øaac</hi> were again≈øt him, God would be again≈øt him too; he could not be an enemy to <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> but he mu≈øt be an enemy to God; he thinks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its be≈øt for him, even for his own peace and ≈øafety, to be
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:113533:166"/> at peace with <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> and to make a Covenant with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.28. The like we ≈øee in the <hi>Shechemits</hi> that make a Covenant with <hi>Iacob;</hi> but they alledge the rea≈øon of it; ≈øhall not their flocks, and their cattle, and ≈øub≈øtance bee ours? <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.23. Thus it is in the Covenants of men; but it is otherwi≈øe in the Covenant which he makes with his people; he looks for no benefit by us in his Covenant with us, but only to communicate good unto us; His Covenant is free, <hi>I will love them freely,</hi> ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>Ho≈øeah</hi> 14.4. And it is ≈øo free in two re≈øpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In re≈øpect of his entering into Covenant with us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In re≈øpect of his performance of it.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, In re≈øpect of his entering into Covenant with us, there being nothing in us moving the Lord to take us into Covenant with him, but only his own grace, it is his good plea≈øure to love us, and doe us good; though wee come without ≈øilver, without any thing of worth in us, yet we may come unto him, and be taken into Covenant with him, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 55.1, 3. Hence it is, that when God enters into Covenant with his people, he is ≈øaid <hi>to give them his Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17.2. for ≈øo the word is in the originall, <hi>I will give thee my Covenant:</hi> In our tran≈ølation it is, <hi>I will make my Covenant betwixt mee and thee:</hi> but in the originall, <hi>I will give, &amp;c.</hi> As in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.12. God is ≈øaid to give the Covenant of the Prie≈øthood unto <hi>Phineas</hi> as a gift; ≈øo God gives the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of his grace, unto all that he takes into Covenant with him: Hence al≈øo are tho≈øe expre≈ø≈øions u≈øed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord ≈øet his love upon you to take you into Covenant with him, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ye were more in number then other people, but becau≈øe he loved you, and cho≈øe your Fathers;</hi> as noting out the freene≈ø≈øe of his love towards them, loving them becau≈øe he loved them: and the con≈øtancy of his love towards their Fathers, towards whom he would keep the oath which he had ≈øworn unto them; this was all the cau≈øe that moved the Lord to take them into Covenant with him: And hereto agrees that of <hi>Samuel, It plea≈øed the Lord to make you his people,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22. That <hi>they</hi> were become the people of God, rather then <hi>Aegyptians, Moabites, Ammonites,</hi> or others, was not for any thing which the Lord ≈øaw in them more then in other people, but it plea≈øed the Lord, it was his good plea≈øure to chu≈øe them, and to make them his people.</p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:113533:166"/>
               <p>This freene≈ø≈øe of grace in entering into Covenant with us, may appeare by the≈øe particulas:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God is fir≈øt in ≈øeeking after us to draw us into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him≈øelfe; wee ≈øeek not him, but he ≈øeeks us; we chu≈øe not him, but he chu≈øeth us, he loves us fir≈øt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.16. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.19. And in this re≈øpect he is ≈øaid to be found of tho≈øe that ≈øeek not after him, becau≈øe hee fir≈øt reveales and offers him≈øelfe in mercy unto us, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 65.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But though he be fir≈øt in ≈øeeking after us, may there not bee ≈øomething in us to draw his eyes, and heart unto us? the man ≈øeeks fir≈øt after the unmarried virgin, but there is beauty or dowry which drawes him: But there is no ≈øuch thing in us, there is no worth in us, he ≈øees us polluted in our blood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 6. he ≈øaw us contemptible and vile, ≈øo as none would regard us, ver≈ø. 5. and yet then doth the Lord take us up, and enters into a Covenant with us, ver≈ø. 8. This unworthine≈ø≈øe of ours made <hi>Abraham</hi> to wonder when hee heard the Lord ≈øpeak of making a Covenant with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.3. And this ≈øame made <hi>David</hi> to break out into that affectionate and admiring demand, <hi>Lord, who am I, that thou ≈øhoulde≈øt ≈øpeak thus unto thy ≈øervant?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is de≈øert in us to the contrary, to keep off the Lord from ever owning ≈øuch a people as we were; yea, though we ≈øhould have ≈øought after him: As</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Our former vile unfaithfulne≈ø≈øe in that fir≈øt Covenant he made with us, wherein we dealt treacherou≈øly again≈øt him, for≈øaking him and lightly e≈øteeming the God of our ≈øalvation, as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øpeaks of <hi>I≈ørael, Deut.</hi> 32.15. we brake the Tables of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ca≈øt them away from us; yea, and ca≈øt away the Lord from being our God; the more unde≈øerved therefore, and more free was that grace which moved the Lord to make a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with us, having been ≈øo fal≈øe to him in the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The enmity that is in us again≈øt him, and again≈øt the things that plea≈øe him; we are as contrary unto him, as is darkne≈ø≈øe to light, and evill to good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. we are a crooked generation, that cannot abide the ≈øtreight wayes of the Lord; our whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ≈øinfull and corrupt before him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Con≈øider the time wherein the Lord takes us by the hand to bring us into Covenant with him, and then we ≈øhall finde that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:113533:167"/> when we are mo≈øt aver≈øe and backward, and have lea≈øt thought of ever ≈øeeking after him, then it is that he ≈øeeks us to take us unto him≈øelfe. Thus the Lord called <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was per≈øecuting, raging, breathing out ≈ølaughter, and threatnings again≈øt the Lord, and again≈øt his Saints, then the Lord takes him by the hand, and enters into Covenant with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9 and ≈øo it was with tho≈øe mockers, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.13, 37. here were no di≈øpo≈øitions and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before on their part, but tree and unexpected grace from God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Compare tho≈øe that are taken into Covenant with other that are left out (for all are not taken in, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2.12. there be that are without God, without Covenant) and this will al≈øo make it manife≈øt, it is free grace by which any are taken in: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we look upon tho≈øe that are taken into Covenant, and tho≈øe that are left, we ≈øhall finde that there is no difference in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, betwixt one and other; <hi>we have all ≈øinned, and there is no difference,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, 23. No rea≈øon therefore in us, why one is taken into Covenant, and not another, but only free grace in God; for if it be not free grace towards them that are taken in, then there is inju≈øtice and wrong done to tho≈øe that are left: If there were any worth in tho≈øe that are taken, there was as much in tho≈øe that are left, and therefore either it mu≈øt be free grace towards the one, or there is inju≈øtice and wrong to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other; but what bla≈øphemous mouth dare impute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe and wrong to the righteous God? he owes nothing to any; he may truly ≈øay to all men, <hi>I doe thee no wrong, Matth.</hi> 20.13. Thou ha≈øt as much as I owe thee. Both ≈øorts therefore being in them≈øelves alike, and no wrong done to tho≈øe that are left, it mu≈øt needs be free grace in tho≈øe that are taken in; apply <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As ≈øometimes there is no difference betwixt one and other; ≈øo ≈øometimes God chu≈øeth the wor≈øe, takes in the more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and leaves tho≈øe that are better then they, <hi>Paul</hi> a chiefe of ≈øinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. Publicans and Harlots, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with ≈øeven Devills; the≈øe were taken in; and the righteous generation (as they were reputed) which ju≈øtified them≈øelves, and were ju≈øtified by others, were left and pa≈ø≈øed
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:113533:167"/> by. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.7, 8. The Lord tells the Prophet, that if he would have ≈øent him to another ≈øtrange people (as he ≈øent <hi>Jonah</hi> to the <hi>Ninevites</hi>) they would have hearkned unto him and obeyed him, but the hou≈øe of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> will not obey thee; and yet for all this God ≈øent his Prophet to them, and not to the other, to the wor≈øe and not to the better, and ≈øo <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.23. Thus it is in the communication of him≈øelf in the Covenant of grace; he ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pa≈ø≈øeth by ≈øuch as ≈øeeme better, and takes the wor≈øe, to the end that it might appeare that he re≈øpects none for any thing that is in them, but that the freene≈ø≈øe of his grace might be ≈øeene in tho≈øe whom he takes unto him≈øelfe: This is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle points at, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 27, 28, 29. God chu≈øeth the fooli≈øh things of the world, the weak things, ba≈øe and de≈øpi≈øed things, things which are not, pa≈ø≈øing by the wi≈øe, the mighty, and things which are in e≈øteeme, that all might ≈øee it is nothing in man, but the grace of God by which we are taken into communion and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the grace of the Covenant is thus free in the making of it, ≈øo it is al≈øo in the accompli≈øhment of it; the ble≈ø≈øings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are as free grace in the be≈øtowing, as they were in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øing: Not that God is now free to performe or not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, for he cannot but performe that which he hath promi≈øed: but yet he owes the ble≈ø≈øing to us in regard of his own promi≈øe, faithfulne≈ø≈øe and goodne≈ø≈øe, not in regard of any worth that is in us; for though there be our obedience of faith intervening and comming between Gods promi≈øe, and between his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, yet the performance is as free grace as is the promi≈øe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there is no ≈øuch worth in any of our obedience, as to which the ble≈ø≈øing ≈øhould be done in a way of ju≈øtice: He cannot deny him≈øelfe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. nor can he alter the thing which is gone out of his lips, <hi>P≈øal</hi> 89.34. otherwi≈øe, the ble≈ø≈øing of the Covenant is as well freely given, as it was freely promi≈øed: And therefore it is that the Prophet ≈øpeaking of the performance of the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> (but was to be performed to his ≈øeed) he ≈øpeaks in this manner, <hi>Thou wilt performe truth unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>and mercy unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>as thou hast ≈øworn unto our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in old time, Micah</hi> 7.20. Gods truth gives a≈ø≈øurance that hee will doe it (thou wilt performe truth unto <hi>Jacob</hi>) but yet its
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:113533:168"/> mercy when its performed (thou wilt performe mercy unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> &amp;c.) and thence it is that in <hi>Iude</hi> v. 21. the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaking to the Saints, exhorts them to wait for the <hi>mercy</hi> of the Lord unto eternall life; and in <hi>Rom</hi> 6.23. Life eternall is called a gift, freely given by free grace: and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. we are ≈øaid to be <hi>heires of the grace of life,</hi> becau≈øe grace is the cau≈øe, as well of <hi>our inheriting life,</hi> as of <hi>Gods promi≈øing;</hi> for though we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Spirit of grace, to renew and ≈øanctifie us; yet in many things we offend ≈øtill, ≈øtanding in need of forgivene≈ø≈øe from day to day; and where there is need of forgivene≈ø≈øe, there life mu≈øt needs be of grace, and not of merit or works.</p>
               <p>The Rea≈øons why the Lord would have his Covenant to ≈øtand upon this foundation of free grace; are the≈øe</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be a ground of hope to ≈øuch as ≈øee them≈øelves unworthy of acceptance with God; If the grace of the Covenant were not free, ≈øuch unworthy ones could have no hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the glory of grace to be freely communicated, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come and buy without money:</hi> It darkens the glory of grace, when it is vouch≈øafed for any benefit received, as <hi>Potiphar</hi> favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Io≈øeph,</hi> becau≈øe he ≈øaw God pro≈øper the things that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.3.4. but where favour is wholly free, there it ≈øhines forth in the glory of it: and thence it is that when the Lord had made his promi≈øe to the di≈øper≈øed Jewes, concerning their gathering in againe, he tells them that it is not for their ≈øakes, but for his own name ≈øake, thereby to maintaine the glory of his free grace towards them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord would have his Covenant to be a Covenant of free grace, that the ble≈ø≈øing of it might be ≈øure unto tho≈øe to whom the promi≈øe is made: The Lord ≈øaw the un≈øtability of the former Covenant of works, the promi≈øe being made with re≈øpect to that which was in us, or to be done by us, and ≈øo would this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant have been al≈øo, if it had been built upon the like foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore that the ble≈ø≈øing of it might be ≈øure, the promi≈øe is made to depend not upon any thing to be done by us, but upon the free grace of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe</hi> 1. To enforme us from what hand to expect the ble≈ø≈øing of life promi≈øed to us in this Covenant, even from mercy and from grace, not from ju≈øtice; he that will have life, and wring it out
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:113533:168"/> of the hand of ju≈øtice, in ≈øtead of life ≈øhall have the wages of death, as his de≈øerved and ju≈øt reward; See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. It is mercy which the be≈øt mu≈øt look for at that day.</p>

This may be a ground of incouragement to ≈øuch as are (or at lea≈øt ≈øeem to them≈øelves to be) afar off, aliens to God, ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to his Covenant; let them draw neer, and ≈øeek to be partakers of this grace ≈øo freely offered, the ble≈ø≈øings whereof are great, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value, yet are they as free as great; in re≈øpect of greatnes they might ≈øeem to be above hope, but in re≈øpect of the freene≈ø≈øe of them they are under hope; by this con≈øideration the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth his people, to ≈øeek unto him for acceptance, (<hi>Receive us graciou≈øly, Ho≈ø.</hi> 14.2.) and if any ≈øay but alas how can we which have for≈øaken our God, and gone after our Idols, and done ≈øuch abominations, be accepted by him? hereto the Lord an≈øwers, I will love them freely; he looks for no worth in us, for which he ≈øhould ≈øhew grace unto us, but only that we mu≈øt accept that which is ≈øo freely offered.</p>
               <p>Its u≈øuall with ≈øuch as mo≈øt de≈øire and long after grace, to be mo≈øt fearfull and doubtfull of obtaining; Oh, there is ≈øo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthine≈ø≈øe in them, how can they hope to finde acceptance with God, they can ≈øee nothing in them≈øelves for which God ≈øhould accept them, and tis true; but though you can ≈øee <hi>nothing in your ≈øelves,</hi> yet you may ≈øee <hi>enough in God;</hi> Looking downward you ≈øee unworthine≈ø≈øe in your ≈øelves; but look upward and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold riches of free grace in God; Grace is never the further off becau≈øe you can ≈øee no worthine≈ø≈øe in your ≈øelves, nay, the more you di≈øcerne your ≈øelves unworthy, the more neer is the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace to be manife≈øted in you, if ye tru≈øt unto it; ≈øay not therefore you are unworthy, thereby nouri≈øhing di≈øtru≈øt in your ≈øelfe; but ≈øay rather, though I be unworthy, yet I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ≈øelfe to that free grace of God which is vouch≈øafed to unworthy ones; nay, I ≈øay more, ≈øuch as are not unworthy, ≈øhall never ta≈øte of this mercy and grace of God, its given to none but to unworthy ones: The very thought and opinion of our own worthine≈ø≈øe dwelling in us, excludes us and cuts off from grace; here is then a prop to our weak faith, this puts a plea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouthes of all dejected ≈øouls; let them look to this ≈øweet name of grace, here take hold, here re≈øt, here ca≈øt anchor, in

We mu≈øt an≈øwer, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing, Lord, nothing in our ≈øelves; onely thou art gracious who freely pardone≈øt the ≈øins of thy people; I cannot de≈øire to be accepted of thee for any thing that is in me, but I commit my ≈øelfe to thy free and rich grace, which is able to do for me abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly above that I can aske or thinke.</p>
               <p>And here (to adde a word more concerning the ab≈øolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, of which I have ≈øpoken ≈øomething before) we may by that which hath been ≈øpoken, di≈øcerne the right u≈øe of tho≈øe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, they are to be incouragements or attractives to draw us to rely upon free grace in ≈øuch times when we are mo≈øt di≈øcouraged in our ≈øelves; there be ≈øeverall ≈øea≈øons in which both kinds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes (both ab≈øolute and conditionall) are of ≈øpeciall u≈øe; there is a time wherein the ≈øoule is apt to ≈ølumber, being overtaken with a ≈øpirit of ≈øecurity, apt to pre≈øume and to walke negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; there is a time al≈øo of di≈ømayedne≈ø≈øe and dejection of Spirit, every thing cau≈øing feare, though we walke in con≈øcionable care before God.

               <p>To conclude, Let us ≈øtudy ≈øo to walk, that this may be our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and dignity among the Nations of the world, among which we live: That they may be con≈øtrained to ≈øay of us, only this people is wi≈øe, an holy and ble≈ø≈øed people; that all that ≈øee us, may ≈øee and know that the name of the Lord is called upon us; and that we are the ≈øeed which the Lord hath ble≈ø≈øed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.10. <hi>E≈øay</hi> 61.9. There is no people but will ≈øtrive to excell in ≈øome thing; what can we excell in, if not in holine≈ø≈øe? If we look to number, we are the fewe≈øt; If to ≈øtrength, we are the weake≈øt; If to wealth and riches, we are the poore≈øt of all the people of God through the whole world, we can not excell (nor ≈øo much as equall) other people in the≈øe things; and if we come ≈øhort in grace and holine≈ø≈øe too, we are the mo≈øt de≈øpicable people under heaven; our worldly dignitie is gone, if we lo≈øe the glory of grace too, then is the glory wholly departed from our <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vile; ≈øtrive we therefore herein to excell, and ≈øuffer not this crown to be taken away from us: Be we an holy people, ≈øo ≈øhall we be honourable before God, and precious in the eyes of his Saints.</p>
               <p>And thus al≈øo of the properties of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now the God of peace, that brought againe the Lord Ie≈øus, the great ≈øhepheard of the ≈øheep, through the blood of the everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, make us perfect in all good works to doe his will; working in us that which is plea≈øing in his ≈øight, through Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, to whom be pray≈øe for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
