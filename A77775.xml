         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>they doe concerne. This Covenant hath been a port of refuge, to which the Saints have alwayes fled in their diſtreſſes, they claiming the bleſſing therein contained and grounding their hope upon the faithfulnes of him that hath promiſed. This Covenant hath been the rock for the anchor of their hope to faſten upon, when the winds &amp; waves of temptation have beaten upon them. The troubles of the Church &amp; people of God are not yet finiſhed, by reaſon whereof we, no leſſe then our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before us, do ſtand in need of help and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from this Covenant in theſe dayes of affliction in which we live. Neither is it only a conſolation to know the great things which God hath by Covenant promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto us, but it is a foundation to all godlineſſe and holy walking before God, perſwading us to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Lord, as beſeems thoſe whom he hath taken into Covenant with him, to be a peculiar people to himſelf. God hath ſo linked together the bleſſing of the Covenant (which is his to give) with the dutie and way of it, (which is ours to walk in) that we cannot with comfort expect the one, but it will worke in us a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full endeavour of the other. To ſpeake more hereof, I ſhall forbeare. When I had finiſhed this Treatiſe, and bethought my ſelf to whom I ſhould dedicate it, I could not thinke of any, to whom it was ſo ſuitable as your ſelf. You are (to omit other relations) one of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Covenant, which was firſt made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> your Father, and with <hi>Sarah</hi> your Mother, both which, as they lived by faith, ſo they dyed in faith, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now received the end of their faith, which they waited for. Your honoured Father, the thoughts of whom are ever precious unto me, was a right <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed; If I ſhould ſpeake leſſe of him, I ſhould ſpeak too little of that ſingular piety, and exemplary grace
<pb facs="tcp:113533:2"/> and godlines which ſhined in him. I abhorre giving ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles unto man, but give me leave to beare witnes unto the truth. I knew his faith, his feare, his uprightneſſe and holy walking before his God, whereby he became as <hi>a Prince of God</hi> among the people of the world,<note place="margin">Gen. 23.</note> with whom he lived. Wherein he went before you alſo, as a patterne to be for ever in your eye, to be imitated by you. Sir, let it (I beſeech you) be your chiefeſt care, and count it your higheſt honour, to walke in the ſteps of your pious &amp; bleſſed Father. His faith follow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what was the end of his converſation. That ſweet peace, thoſe heavenly conſolations, which he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of, thoſe inward feelings which carried him out of himſelf, even whiles he was yet in the fleſh, are ſtrong engagements and encouragements unto you, to walke after his foote, as the Prophets expreſſion is, treading in the ſame ſteps of faith and holines in which he went before you. I am ſure you cannot forget thoſe dying words of his a little before his end, (You that are in the fleſh thinke, &amp;c. I ſpare the reſt) in mention whereof I ſpeak a myſtery to others (being but a broken ſound) but not to you; you can interpret my meaning and 'tis enough to me that you know the meaning of them, for whoſe ſake I mention them, that you may often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them for your own good. They will never out of my heart, and I truſt they will never be forgotten by you. Goe on (deare Sir,) in the wayes of grace which you are entred into, the Lord having made good his Covenant towards you, be you alſo mindfull to walke in Covenant with your God. Set Gods kindneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, to ſtir up your ſelf the more to walke before him in his truth. The more you honour him, the more you honour your ſelf. Study therefore to do great things for God; ſeeke the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:113533:3"/> proſperitie of <hi>Sion.</hi> Your goodnes extendeth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but to his Church and Saints that are here on earth; yet what you doe unto them, he will ſay, <hi>Yee have done it unto mee.</hi> Remember <hi>Davids</hi> troubles, <hi>Joſephs</hi> affliction, <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds, the diſtreſſed eſtate of Gods Church and people, and thinke of <hi>Mordecai</hi> his <hi>Item</hi> to <hi>Eſther.</hi> This way was <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit working when he was ſitting in peace in his own houſe; He was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what the LORD had done for him, and what he ſhould render to the Lord for all his benefits. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull was his zeale for the Houſe of God; The coſt he prepared for it was almoſt incredible, an hundred thouſand talents of gold, beſides ſilver &amp; other things without number; but he loſt nothing by all, (no man loſeth by lending to the Lord, no more then the rivers doe by powring their water into the Sea, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive back againe by ſecret paſſages in the earth, and ſo are ſtill ever full.) The more he honoured God, the more God honoured him. He ſpared not his riches in things pertaining to God, and God caſt in more upon him ſtill, ſo that he dyed in riches and honour, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.28. Let your life be like his, and then in death you ſhall not be divided. The God of all grace, who hath done ſo great things for you, go on in bleſſing to bleſſe you, that you may with <hi>Nephthali</hi> be ſatisfied with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and filled with the bleſſing of the Lord, even with all bleſſings of heaven and earth, of this life, and of that to come.</p>

This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant here ſpoken of, is a Covenant of life and peace, and therefore ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is alſo the more ſutable, in regard of that holy and gracious practiſe begun by our renowned <hi>Parliament,</hi> going before the body of the Kingdome, in entring into an holy Covenant with the God of heaven, to become the Lords people, the onely way to a bleſſed peace. Till we be at one with God, it will be in vaine by humane policies to deviſe wayes of peace with men; but peace being once made in heaven, will bring peace on earth, and good will amongst men. If otherwiſe man ſtill rage, yet ſhall his rage be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and turne to Gods praiſe, the Lord on high hath a bridle for his lips, and an hooke for his noſtrills; he will ſubdue the oppreſſour, and will ſtill the enemy and the avenger. Bleſſed be they whoſe care it hath been to draw the Land into this holy covenanting with God; let mercy and peace be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as upon all the Iſrael of God. And bleſſed be that God, who hath put this care into their hearts, as being the onely way to obtaine an aſſured bleſſing. This Covenant ſo happily begun, is the principall ſubject of this booke, in which thou mayſt ſee both the neceſſitie for every ſoule to enter into a Covenant with God, and how it is to be done, as alſo how thoſe that have made a Covenant with God, are to walke in it, and what bleſſings doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto thoſe that ſo walke. When theſe things were firſt preached in <hi>New-England,</hi> there was little thought of publiſhing them in ſuch a time.
<pb facs="tcp:113533:4"/> But he which inhabiteth eternitie, with whom all things are preſent, fits things paſt, to thoſe that are preſent, and to come, that his wiſdome might be knowne to order all, beyond what we conceive or thinke. It is now ſome five or ſix yeares ſince I firſt began to handle this doctrine now publiſhed, a time then full of trouble in theſe American Churches, through the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate activeneſs, and impetuous violence of ſome buſie ſpirits (of whom the Country is now well rid through the Lords great goodnes) deeming all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (except themſelves) to be wholly ignorant of the Covenant of grace, and to be ſhut up under a Covenant of workes; All the Preachers in the Land were legall Preachers, the Chriſtians, legall Chriſtians, as having onely the letter of the Goſpel, but not underſtanding the myſtery or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meaning of it, as it was revealed unto themſelves by the ſpirit. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the two Covenants did then exceedingly trouble the minds of many, amongst whom there was little ſpeech but about the covenant of grace and of workes, and of being under a Covenant of workes. I having then in the courſe of my Miniſtery propounded to my ſelf this order to follow, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on one part of the Lords day to handle one part of the body of Divinitie, concerning God, Creation, Man, his firſt pure eſtate, and ſo on, concluding that part with his lapſed and falne eſtate; and on the other part of the day to ſpeak of the means of Gods reſtoring man againe to the ſtate of ſalvation; I could not then paſſe by the handling of the Covenant of grace, without a purpoſed declining from that, which both the agitations of the Countrey, and mine own propoſed method did lead me unto. Hereupon I entred upon the handling of this ſubject in the ordinary courſe of my Miniſtry, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring my ſelf (ſo far as the Lord enabled me) to ſettle the minds of thoſe amongst whom I lived, in the knowledge of the truth, concerning which ſome were wavering, by reaſon of thoſe ſpirits of error which were gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, deceiving the minds of ſome. This was the occaſion of handling this doctrine. When I had finiſhed it, it pleaſed God to give it ſuch acceptance in the hearts of the hearers, that many of the chiefe amongst them came to me with a ſolemn requeſt, deſiring me to publiſh what I had delivered, that ſo they might have it continue with them, which requeſt of theirs, as it was unexpected by me, ſo was I both unwilling, and unable to ſatisfie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; unwilling, as being conſcious to my ſelf of mine own infirmities, unfit to publiſh any thing in this learned age; and unable, as not having ſo pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any part of it, as to make it fit for publick uſe. But the earneſtneſſe of their deſire on the one ſide, and the rawneſſe of the draught which I had written for the help of my ſelf, on the other ſide, ſo far croſſing one another, gave occaſion of a ſecond reviſing of what was before done; which alſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:113533:4"/> ſome further additions thereunto, and hath at laſt brought forth that (ſuch as it is) which is now preſented to thy view. And thus thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt (gentle Reader) the occaſion both of the preaching and publiſhing of the doctrine of the Covenant which now comes forth. Which (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the former inducements) I ſhould hardly have adventured to have publiſhed, had I not been encouraged thereto by ſome others of better note. It is not any confidence I have in my ſelf which hath drawne me forth into publick view. I thank God, I do in ſome meaſure know mine own weaknes. But if the Lord will uſe his weakeſt inſtruments to perfect his own praiſe, who am I that I ſhould let God? I wiſh this had been undertaken by ſome other of greater ſtrength, but none hitherto appearing in this kinde, being deſired to what I have done, I have been content to yeeld to the deſires of thoſe that have perſwaded me hereunto. There is a Treatiſe of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> publiſhed ſome yeares ago by a precious light in the Church of God, whoſe worke is come almoſt into all mens hands. If that worthy ſervant of Chriſt, had lived to ſee theſe dayes we now live in, or then were, when theſe things were delivered, I doubt not but he would with much more accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe have handled theſe things then my weakneſſe is able to attaine unto. But God having carried him to his reſting place, before theſe queſtions brake forth, which have ſince troubled, and doe ſtill trouble the world, it is not to be marvelled that ſome one coming after him, inferior unto him, may adde ſomething to that which hath been before delivered. The opinions formerly ſtirring in <hi>New-England,</hi> and now in old, (if fame be not a lyer) have given occaſion to touch ſome things not of ordinary occurrence. As namely, <hi>1.</hi> Whether the Covenant of grace be made betwixt God and man, or onely betwixt God the Father and Chriſt. <hi>2.</hi> Where alſo (by occaſion of the former queſtion) is handled that place in <hi>Gal. 3.16.</hi> concerning the one ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which the promiſes are made, which ſeede is Chriſt, ſhewing who is that one ſeed there called Chriſt. <hi>3.</hi> What the Covenant at <hi>Sinai</hi> was, whether a Covenant of workes, or of grace. <hi>4.</hi> Whether juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be evidenced by ſanctification, &amp; whether that way of evidencing be a going aſide to a Covenant of workes; and whether one under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works may be truly ſanctified. <hi>5.</hi> Whether the commandement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding faith, be a commandement of the Law, or no. <hi>6.</hi> Whether faith be a condition onely conſequent to our juſtification, &amp; not antecedent. <hi>7.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conditionall promiſes be promiſes of free grace or no, and of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with thoſe promiſes which are called <hi>abſolute.</hi> Theſe and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch paſſages are herein touched, as occaſion was miniſtred by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter handled. And in regard that ſome of the ſame opinions are now ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:113533:5"/> in old <hi>England,</hi> which lately troubled New, my hope in the Lord is, that this my weak endeavour (the Lord accompanying it with his bleſſing) may be of ſome uſe now in theſe times; if not to recall thoſe that are led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by errour, yet to ſettle ſome that are doubtfull and wavering in the truth. But though theſe things are touched here and there, yet my chiefe ayme hath been to lead on the weake Chriſtian to a practicall uſe of the truths which are here delivered; in which the greateſt part of this work is ſpent. If in any of theſe, thou findeſt thy ſelf helped by this my labour, either in thy knowledge or practiſe, returne glory to God, and help me by thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that I may ſo finiſh that little remnant of my courſe which is yet before me, that I may rejoyce in the day of Chriſt, that I have not run in vaine, neither have laboured in vaine. If any that are more judicious ſhall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſee what is herein performed, and ſhall thinke themſelves burdened with interruption by reaſon of application by uſe of each point delivered; I deſire them to conſider, that as in the preaching, ſo in the publiſhing of this Treatiſe, it was then, &amp; is now, intended rather for their ſakes which ſtand in need of both, then for ſuch as need not. I write not to teach the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, but to help the weak, who ſtand in need not only to know the truth, but to be led on, to ſee how the knowledge of it doth ſerve to any uſe for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of life. One thing more I may not omit; Whereas it may be marvailed, that in the beginning of the Treatiſe I propound two points to be handled, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, to ſhew the nature of the Covenant of grace, and ſecondly, that we are ſaved by that Covenant, and not by the Covenant of workes, whereas I ſay, both theſe are propounded, and yet I handle but one of them, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my ſo doing is, partly becauſe I ſaw the Treatiſe to exceed in bulk what I expected in the beginning, partly becauſe the handling of the former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth anſwer the end, which in the beginning was aymed at, which was to open the nature and ſubſtance of the Covenant of grace, and partly alſo becauſe this is my firſt adventure in this kinde. If this which I have done ſhall finde acceptance with the Saints, I may adde the reſt in due time, if the Lord give life and ſtrength; otherwiſe I ſhall thinke this enough and too much, which is done already. In the meane time I commend this my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, with thee (courteous Reader) to the bleſſing of God, beſeeching him that is the God of all grace, to enable us ſo to live a life of grace here, that in the end we may enjoy the grace of life, according to the covenant and promiſe of grace <hi>w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He bleſſed God hath evermore delighted to reveale and communicate himſelfe by way of Covenant; he might have done good to man before his fall; as alſo ſince his fall, without binding himſelfe in the bond of Covenant. <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Jewes, Gentiles might have had the bleſſings intended, without any promiſe or Covenant, but the Lords heart is ſo full of love (eſpecially to his owne) that it cannot be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo long within the bounds of ſecrecie, <hi>viz.</hi> from Gods eternall purpoſe to the actuall accompliſhment of good things intended, but it muſt aforehand overflow and breake out into the many ſtreames of a bleſſed Covenant, the Lord can never get neer enough to his people, and thinkes he can never get them neer enough unto himſelfe, and therefore unites and binds and faſtens them cloſe to himſelfe, and himſelfe unto them by the bonds of a Covenant. And therefore when wee breake our Covenant, and that will not hold us, he takes a faſter bond, and makes a ſure and everlaſting Covenant; according to grace, not according to workes, and that ſhall hold his people firme unto himſelfe, and hold himſelfe cloſe and faſt unto them, that he may never depart from us. Oh the depth of Gods grace herein, that when ſinfull man deſerves never to have the leaſt good word from him, that he ſhould open his whole heart and purpoſe to him, in a Covenant; that when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves nothing elſe but ſeparation from God, and to be driven up and downe the world, as a vagabond, or as dryed leaves, fallen from our God, that yet the Almighty God cannot be content with it, but muſt make himſelfe to us, and us to himſelfe more ſure and neare then ever before! And is not this Covenant then (Chriſtian Reader) worth thy looking into and ſearching after? Surely never was there a time wherein the Lord calls his people to more ſerious ſearching into the nature of the Covenant, then in theſe dayes. For are there not ſome who cut off the entaile to children of thoſe in
<pb facs="tcp:113533:6"/> Covenant, and ſo leſſen &amp; ſhorten the riches of grace in the Lords free Covenant, and that in the time of more grace under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, then he was wont to diſpenſe under the Law? Are there not others who preach a new or rather another Goſpel or Covenant, <hi>viz</hi> That actuall remiſſion of ſins, and reconciliation with God (purchaſed indeed in Redemption by Chriſts death) is without, nay, before faith; the Condition (though wrought of God) of the Covenant of grace, expreſly oppoſed to the Law or Covenant of workes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. and ever required as the meanes (and therefore antecedent) to the attainment of thoſe ends in the conſtant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Apoſtles of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.43? Is it not time for the people of God now to pry into the ſecret of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (which he reveales to them that feare him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14.) when by clipping of it, and diſtinguiſhing about it, the beautifull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of it begins to be changed and transformed by thoſe Angels of new light which once it had, when it began to be publiſhed in the ſimplicity of it by the Apoſtles of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. Nay, is not the time come, wherein the Lord of hoſts ſeemes to have a quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the world, and eſpecially his Churches and people, whom he goes on to waſte by the ſharpeſt ſword that (almoſt) was ever drawne out? and is it not the dutie of all that have but the leaſt ſparke of holy feare and trembling, to aske and ſearch diligently, what ſhould be the reaſon of this ſore anger and hot diſpleaſure, before they and theirs be conſumed in the burning flames of it? Search the Scriptures, and there we ſhall find the cauſe, and ſee God himſelf laying his finger upon that which is the ſore, &amp; the wound of ſuch times; for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.1. to 5. <hi>Behold, the Lord maketh the earth emptie and waſte, and turnes it upſide downe, and ſcattereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the inhabitants thereof; and it ſhall be as with the people, ſo with the Prieſt; and the Land ſhall be utterly ſpoyled.</hi> Why? <hi>For the earth is defiled under the Inhabitants thereof;</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe they have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Lawes, changed the Ordinance, and broken the Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi> and therefore when the Lord ſhall have waſted his Church, and hath made it as <hi>Adnah</hi> and <hi>Leboim,</hi> when heathen Nations ſhall aske, Wherefore hath the Lord done all this againſt this Land? what meaneth the heat of his great anger? The anſwer is made by the Lord himſelfe expreſly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.25. viz. <hi>Becauſe they have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the</hi> Covenant <hi>of the Lord God of their fathers, &amp;c.</hi> And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for they that reject the Covenant of grace, they breake the
<pb facs="tcp:113533:6"/> league of peace between God and themſelves; and hence if acts of hoſtilitie in deſolating Kingdomes, Churches, families, and perſons, break out from a long ſuffering God, they may eaſily ſee the cauſe; and that the cauſe and quarrell of God herein is juſt. As all good things are conveyed to Gods people, not barely by common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but by ſpeciall Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.8, 9. So all the evills they meet with in this world (if in them the face of Gods anger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares) upon narrow ſearch will be found to ariſe from breach of Covenant more or leſſe. So that if it be the great Cauſe of all the publick calamities of the Church and people of God, and thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities are already begun, and Gods hand is ſtretched out ſtill; Was there then ever a more ſeaſonable time and houre to ſtudy the Covenant, and ſo ſee the ſin, repent of it, and at laſt to lay hold of Gods rich grace and bowels in it, leſt the Lord goe on and fulfill the word of his ſervants, &amp; expoſe moſt pleaſant lands to the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamentation of a very little remnant, reſerved as a few coales in the aſhes, when all elſe is conſumed. As particular perſons when they breake their Covenant, the Lord therefore breaks out againſt them; So when whole Churches forſake their Covenant, the Lord therefore doth ſorely viſit them. Sins of ignorance the Lord Jeſus pities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. and many times winkes at; but ſins againſt light he cannot endure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Sins againſt light are great, but ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt purpoſe and Covenant, nay Gods Covenant, are by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees worſe; for the ſoule of man ruſheth moſt violently and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt God, when it breakes through all the light of the mind, and purpoſes of the will, that ſtand in his way to keep him from ſin; and is not this done by breach of Covenant? And therefore no wonder if the Lord makes his peoples chaine heavy by ſore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, untill they come to conſider &amp; behold this ſin, and learne more feare (after they are bound to their good behaviour,) of breaking Covenant with God againe. It is true, the Covenant effectually made, can never be really broke, yet externally it may; But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Gods Churches were in greateſt peace, and had a bleſſed reſt from all their labours round about them; yet what is the childes portion, but his legacy left him written with the finger of God his Father, in the new Covenant, and the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, in his laſt Will and Teſtament? What is a Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and where doth it chiefly lie, but in this, That the Lord hath made with him an everlaſting Covenant, in all things ſtabliſhed and
<pb facs="tcp:113533:7"/> ſure? Which were the laſt breathings of the ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the laſt bublings up of the joy of his heart, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. God the Fathers eternall purpoſes are ſealed ſecrets, not immediately ſeene, and the full and bleſſed accompliſhments of thoſe purpoſes are not yet experimentally felt; the Covenant is the midſt between both Gods purpoſes and performances, by which and in which we come to ſee the one, before the world began, and by a bleſſed Faith (which makes things abſent, preſent) to enjoy the other, which ſhall be our glory, when this world ſhall be burnt up, and all things in it ſhall have an end. For in Gods Covenant and promiſe we ſee with open face Gods ſecret purpoſe for time paſt. Gods purpoſes toward his people being as it were nothing elſe but promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and Gods promiſes in the Covenant being nothing elſe but his purpoſes revealed; as alſo in the ſame Covenant and promiſes we ſee performances for future, as if they were accompliſhments at preſent. Where then is a Chriſtians comfort, but in that Covenant wherein two Eternities (as it were) meet together, &amp; whereby he may ſee acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhments (made ſure to him) of eternall glory, ariſing from bleſſed purpoſes of eternall Grace? In a word, wherein he faſtens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and hath him from everlaſting to everlaſting, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at hand neare and obvious in his words of a gracious Covenant?</p>
            <p>The Church of God is therefore bound to bleſſe God much for this food in ſeaſon, and for the holy judicious and learned labours of this aged, experienced, and precious ſervant of Chriſt Jeſus; who hath taken much paines to diſcover, and that not in words and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, but in the demonſtration and evidence of the Spirit, the great myſtery of godlines wrapt up in the Covenant; and hath now fully opened ſundry knotty queſtions concerning the ſame, which happily have not been brought ſo fully to light untill now; which cannot but be of ſingular and ſeaſonable uſe, to prevent Apoſtaſies from the ſimplicity of the Covenant and Goſpel of Chriſt. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were preached in the remote ends of the earth, and as it were ſet under a Buſhell, a Church more remote from the numerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of others of the Saints: if now therefore the light be ſet upon a hill, 'tis where it ſhould ſtand, &amp; where Chriſt ſurely would have it put. The good Lord enlighten the minds of all thoſe who ſeek for the truth by this &amp; ſuch like helps; and the Lord enlighten the whole world with his glory, even with the glory of his Covenant, grace &amp; love, that his people hereby may be ſealed up daily unto all fulneſſe of aſſurance and peace, in theſe evill times.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> was one of thoſe three Prophets, whom God raiſed up to Prophecy to the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> after their returne from the Captivitie of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> And yet ſo after, as that it was in part alſo during the time of captivitie of many of them, many of the <hi>Jewes</hi> remaining ſtill in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> the land of their captivitie, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the libertie proclaimed by <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezra 1.1.</note> Whether length of time, (the captivitie having continued ſeventie yeares) had made the land naturall to thoſe that were young and had been borne there, or whether under <hi>Cyrus</hi> they might hope to finde more eaſe from their burthens then formerly under the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the length of the journey, dangers by the way, the hazzards they might meet withall in their own land, they being now ſetled
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113533:9"/> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and having houſes and orchards, and ſuch like conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences about them; whether (I ſay) it were any of theſe, or all together, that hindered them, this is certain, many of them neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to returne to their own land, in ſo much as the Prophet is faine to call upon them, as he doth in Chapter 2.6, 7. <hi>Hoe, come forth, and flee from the land of the North, deliver thy ſelfe, O Zion, which dwelleſt with the daughter of Babel.</hi> Adding to this call of his many promiſes, to allure and incourage them thereunto. As firſt, By a promiſe of plenteous increaſe and multiplying in their owne land.<note place="margin">Zech. 2.4.</note> Whereas they might feare, that being but few, and a ſmall number, they might be ſcattered and come to nothing, therefore the Lord tells them by the Prophet, that <hi>Jeruſalem ſhould be inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without walls;</hi> meaning that it ſhould not be able to containe the people in it, for their multitude. A ſecond promiſe, is that he would be a protection unto them; <hi>I will be a wall of fire about you,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. A wall of ſafe defence to you, and fire to burne up your enemies, if any invade you. A third promiſe, that <hi>he will be the glory in the midſt of them;</hi> giving them a glorious State or Church. Fourthly, He promiſes his preſence among them, which is the felicitie of any people; <hi>I will dwell in the middeſt of thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. By theſe manifold promiſes, the Lord doth by his Prophet perſwade the people to returne. A ſtrange thing that being captives, they muſt have ſo many motives to returne to the Land of their freedome and libertie.</p>
               <p>Now this Captivitie of the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as it was <hi>res ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi> a thing reall and done, an affliction brought upon them for their ſinning againſt the Lord: So I finde it in Scripture applyed to three things, as a reſemblance and type thereof. Firſt, It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the naturall eſtate of all men, who were at firſt created free, being ſubject to none, but onely to him who is Lord over all, but are now by ſin like the <hi>Jewes</hi> in an eſtate of bondage. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication I finde made by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Come out from among them, touch no uncleane thing.</hi> Which words were firſt ſpoken to and of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in <hi>Eſay</hi> 52. <hi>ver.</hi> 4.11. calling them out of their Captivitie. But the Apoſtle applyes them to all, whether <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their naturall uncleanneſſe, calling upon them to come out of the ſinfull pollution of the world. Secondly, It is applyed to the ſtate of the Church under the tyranny of Antichriſt; for as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113533:9"/> that Eaſterne <hi>Babel</hi> did afflict and oppreſſe the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which were then the Church of God; ſo <hi>Rome</hi> the Weſterne <hi>Babel</hi> doth keepe under the Church of God now, and long time hath done, and therefore the people of God are called to come out of her,<note place="margin">Apoc. 18.2.4.</note> as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were called to come forth from the Eaſterne <hi>Babel,</hi> Jer. 51.6.8.<note place="margin">Jer. 51.6.8.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 42.21.</note> And this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent bondage is typed out by their captivitie in <hi>Babylon;</hi> as we may ſee by comparing <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. with <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.20. That which was in the letter of it, ſpoken of their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from under the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the ſame doth the Apoſtle apply to their laſt deliverance, which is yet to come. <hi>The redeemer ſhall come to Sion, and turne ungodlineſſe from Jacob.</hi> As their captivitie in <hi>Babel,</hi> reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their preſent captive condition now, ſo their deliverance out of <hi>Babel</hi> then, typed out their deliverance which ſhal come unto them out of their preſent miſery, when <hi>the Redeemer ſhall againe come unto Sion, and turne away ungodlineſſe from them.</hi>

And becauſe this Rule may be queſtioned, and yet (if cleared) may be of uſe in reading the Prophets: Therefore for the clearing of it, let us conſider a place or two. Conſider that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.16, 17. Here is a promiſe made to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But to what time is this prophecy to be referred?

               <p>Becauſe in <hi>ver.</hi> 16. it's ſaid (in the time wherein the prophecy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſhould be fulfilled) <hi>They ſhall then ſay no more, the Arke of the Covenant of the Lord, neither ſhall it come to minde, neither ſhall they remember it;</hi> that is, there ſhould be a change of worſhip, the ceremoniall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall be aboliſhed, and they ſhall uſe it no more, they ſhould no more mention the Arke, nor minde it any more.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond Reaſon why this Prophecy is to be referred to theſe times of the Goſpel, is contained in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. Becauſe in the time of this Prophecies accompliſhment, all Nations muſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to joyne with the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the worſhip of God. But all Nations were not gathered to them at their coming out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Indeed ſome mixture there was of other people among the <hi>Jewes;</hi> as is gathered <hi>Nehe.</hi> 13.3. and out of <hi>Ezra.</hi> But that mixture was plainly condemned as ſinfull, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> were commanded to ſeparate themſelves from them. But this gathering of the Nations unto them, is here promiſed as a bleſſing. But admit there was there ſome gathering and addition of other people unto them, which was not ſinfull, ſome becoming Proſelytes, yet this was ſo little a ſcattering, that it cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a gathering of all Nations unto them; for there is as much ſaid before theſe times, as this comes unto in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.38. At their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there was then a mixt multitude of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and yet this was not the time of gathering the Nations to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but a time of ſeparating the <hi>Jewes</hi> from other Nations; as therefore no man will ſay, that there was at their coming out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> an addition of all Nations unto them, though they had then a mixt company joyning unto them; ſo neither at this time of their returne from <hi>Babylon.</hi> Nay, if we conſider the times before this Prophecy was uttered, I ſuppoſe there were ſuch a multitude of ſtrangers joyned to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as was not to be found at this time of their returne from <hi>Babylon;</hi> for wee read that in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, there were found an hundred three &amp; fifty thouſand and upwards, as is expreſſed in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.17. Yet all this number was not a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of all Nations unto them.</p>

                  </label> I grant it was in a gracious meaſure fulfilled then, and yet ſo as to run along to have its full and finall accompliſhment in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113533:11"/> home of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Firſt, In the dayes of Chriſt ſome few of the Jewiſh Nation were converted to the faith, though few, yet ſome were, and ſo there were ſome of the Gentiles alſo. As thoſe wiſe-men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. the Centurion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. the Syrophenician woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. a little number of both. Secondly, Afterwards when the Goſpel was preached by the Apoſtles, they preached firſt to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and many of them believed, three thouſand in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. and afterwards in <hi>Acts</hi> 5. five thouſand: and in <hi>Acts</hi> 21.20. Thou ſeeſt how many thouſand <hi>Jewes</hi> believe. Now mark a little anſwerable increaſe in the converſion of the Gentiles alſo: As the ſound of the Goſpel went all over the world, ſo the ſucceſſe was anſwerable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.19. ſo that there were many Churches of the Gentiles; as is evident in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thirdly, But yet further, as there ſhall be a more full degree of calling home the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then was in either of the times mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before, and they ſhall come in, in more abundance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12. both <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> being called, ſo ſhall the Gentiles come in, in more plenty then hitherto. And in this the Apoſtle is cleare and full in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12. where ſpeaking of the calling of the <hi>Jewes</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That if their fall was the riches of the Gentiles, how much more ſhall their abundance be?</hi> That is, their calling, (which ſhall be in great abundance) ſo that, <hi>then</hi> moſt properly is the time, wherein the Nations ſhall be gathered to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> namely, when the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall be called, and all Nations then added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon to prove this Prophecy not to be accompliſhed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their returne from <hi>Babylon,</hi> is from the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe alſo, where the promiſe is, that after the returne here ſpoken of, they ſhall not walke after the ſtubbornneſſe of their evill heart any more. But if this be applyed to their returne out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> wee may then ſay, this promiſe was not fulfilled, for certainly they never ſhewed more obſtinacy and ſtubbornneſſe then ſince that time, as is evident in their malicious wickedneſſe againſt Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh. So that it cannot be referred to thoſe times; but if wee refer this promiſe to the time of their laſt converſion, it ſhall then be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe from that time, they ſhall never any more turne away from God, but ſhall continue faithfull with him for ever; as is clearly promiſed to them in <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.20, 21. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113533:12"/> 26. This place then in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. ſhews thus much, that the promiſe being made to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> together, the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof was not at their returne from <hi>Babylon,</hi> but is to be accompliſhed in their converſion to the faith of Chriſt. Another place to confirme the ſame rule before named, may be that in the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.16, 17. And ſo to the end of the Chapter, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> (reſembled by the two ſtickes in his hand) to be one people, under one King: But I will not ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y on this: The ſumme is the promiſe here in my Text, being made to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> both, therefore this prophecy belongs to the times yet to come, when both of them ſhall be turned to the Lord. And this is the ſecond Reaſon.</p>
               <p>A third Reaſon is from the enemy ſpoken of to be deſtroyed by <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> together, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>When I have raiſed up thy ſonnes, O Sion, againſt thy ſonnes, O Graecia:</hi> meaning that God would by the ſtrength of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> together, beate to powder the Prince of <hi>Grecia.</hi> But who is he? Some refer this to the ſucceſſours of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the mightie Prince of <hi>Graecia,</hi> called the <hi>Goat,</hi> Dan. 8.5. that ran over all with ſuch ſpeed and ſwiftneſſe. But thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> expoſition cannot ſtand; Firſt, Becauſe theſe ſucceſſours of <hi>Alexander</hi> did mightily afflict the <hi>Jewes;</hi> but the <hi>Jewes</hi> were not made ſuch a Gyants ſword, as to prevaile againſt them. Secondly, Becauſe this conquering the Prince of <hi>Graecia</hi> followes the coming of Chriſt, whereas thoſe ſucceſſours of <hi>Alexander</hi> that troubled the <hi>Jewes</hi> were long before. Thirdly, It cannot (that I know) be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Ephraim</hi> or the ten Tribes had any thing to doe with theſe forces that were guided by the ſucceſſours of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo doe confeſſe, that refer the ſtory to thoſe times, and therefore to make their interpretation ſtand, they take <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> for <hi>ſynonymaes,</hi> for one and the ſame people, which is contrary to all Scripture, they being ever taken as two people; ever ſince the diviſion under <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> onely at their calling home, then they ſhall be reunited againe. Therefore (though I dare not be peremptory in ſuch particulars, yet) with leave and ſubmiſſion to better light, I ſuppoſe this Prince of <hi>Graecia</hi> is the great Turke, which is Lord of <hi>Graecia</hi> at this day, againſt whom <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall have a glorious victory, and ſhall ſubdue this proud enemy. Upon theſe grounds, I conceive, the Prophecy is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113533:12"/> to thoſe times to come. I will not omit what I conceive lies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in that word <hi>(alſo)</hi> in my Text, which ſeemes to have ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall emphaſis and force in it, when it's ſaid, <hi>As for thee</hi> alſo, <hi>thou ſhalt be ſaved by the bloud, &amp;c. I have ſent forth thy priſoners, &amp;c.</hi> He had told them before in verſe 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, that Chriſt ſhall come; then in verſe 10. he tells them the Gentiles ſhall be called; and then addes in verſe 11. <hi>As for thee alſo thou ſhalt be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, though thou (O <hi>Sion</hi>) for thy rejecting of Chriſt come unto thee, ſhalt for a time be forſaken, and caſt as a priſoner into the pit, into miſerable thraldome, yet at length, <hi>even thou alſo</hi> ſhalt be delivered and brought back into glorious libertie; for a while thou muſt be a poore priſoner or captive, in the pit of the priſon, and the Gentiles ſet in the beſt roome; but yet <hi>thou alſo</hi> ſhalt againe be brought out of the pit, in which thou art holden. Thus ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.23. Though for the preſent the Gentiles be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, and Jewes broken off; yet ſhall <hi>they alſo</hi> be graffed in again. The Apoſtle putting in the word <hi>(alſo)</hi> in the ſame emphaticall manner, as it is here uſed by the Prophet.</p>
               <p>In the words are two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The preſent eſtate and miſery of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> they are as priſoners in a pit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A promiſe of reſtitution, they ſhall be ſet free.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are priſoners in the pit of the priſon-houſe, they are now brought low; they were ſometimes the onely people. It was ſaid of them, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 33.29. <hi>No people like thy people Iſrael,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.23. But now they are become a people ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and peeled, ſpoyled, and troden under-feet; ſometimes they had the high places of the earth in poſſeſſion, dwelling in a Land which was the glory of all lands, but now they are brought downe into the lower parts of the earth, priſoners in the pit; they are a captive, an enſlaved people, being made as a very footſtoole for the enemy to tread upon. This have they brought upon themſelves, for their ſinfull rejecting of Chriſt, and putting from them the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:113533:13"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>See hence what the contempt of Chriſt and the Goſpel brings a people unto; where the Goſpel comes, and is received, it magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Nation, ſets it up on high, it lifts them up to heaven in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; as Chriſt ſpake of <hi>Capernaum, Mat.</hi> 11.

It's a ſweet ſpeech of <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>That where ſin abounds, there grace aboundeth much more;</hi> but it is as terrible on the other ſide, that where grace doth abound (in the offers of it by the Goſpel) there ſin, and wrath by ſin, abounds much more alſo, (where that grace is diſeſteemed) therefore it is, that Chriſt tells the <hi>Jews, If he had not come unto them they ſhould have had no ſin, but now they have no excuſe nor cloake for their ſin,</hi> Joh. 15.22. The ſins of harlots, whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſwearers, drunkards, murderers, are leſſe then this ſin of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. Publicans and harlots are better then they; the filthineſſe of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> is knowne, they were exceeding ſinners againſt the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.13. their ſins were not of the common ſort, but exceeded; and therefore they periſhed not by the common viſitation of all men, but their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was exemplary, to ſtand as a warning to all ages; <hi>a fire not blowne by man</hi> (as it is in <hi>Job</hi> 20.26.) conſumed them, the fire of God fell upon them from heaven. This was terrible; and yet their ſin was leſſe then this ſin of rejecting the Goſpel, and their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be more eaſie in the day of Judgement, then theirs ſhall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113533:13"/> be, which receive not the grace of the Goſpel, when it is brought unto them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. Heathens ſhall periſh in their ignorance, and thoſe that dyed under the light of the Law, ſhall have heavier pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but thoſe that neglect the grace of the Goſpel, ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed both: when God puniſhed the wickedneſſe of the <hi>Jewes</hi> before Chriſts coming, it was a very heavie plague which was brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, it was an evill, and an onely evill, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.5. It was ſuch a plague that under the whole heavens had not been the like, as was done unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Dan. 9.12. And yet afterwards when Chriſt had come to them, and was rejected by them, his wrath was then more heavie. Oh the miſeries which then they endured! then God ſtirred up all his anger, and gave way to his wrath, even to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt; then he fulfilled that which he had afore ſpoken, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.23. He ſpent his plagues and arrowes upon them, as if he would emptie the treaſure of all his plagues which he had laid up in ſtore, in executing them upon that people. And this the Lord Jeſus fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them while he was with them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.7. and forewarned them of what would follow, if having the vineyard in their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they did not yeeld the fruit of it; he told them, the Lord would miſerably deſtroy thoſe husbandmen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.41. One of our tranſlations reads it, <hi>He will cruelly deſtroy</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) And certainly, the Lord never ſhewed ſo great ſeveritie againſt any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he will doe againſt thoſe which deſpiſe the meſſage of grace brought by the Goſpel, even as that people is now become a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of wrath above all people. When the Scripture threatens a woe, it notes the extremitie of that miſery which is to come; but here is woe upon woe threatned againſt this ſin, <hi>woe to thee Bethſaida, woe to thee Chorazin,</hi> woe to thoſe places where the Goſpel comes, and is not regarded. It's a thundering ſpeech of the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. where he ſaith, <hi>That thoſe that ſinned under Moſes Law, dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy,</hi> and yet much ſorer vengeance ſhall be unto thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Goſpel of Chriſt. Can any thing be worſe then to dye without mercy? Yes (ſaith the Apoſtle) thoſe ſhall have ſorer ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; It ſhall be vengeance that they ſuffer; yea ſore vengeance, and ſorer then thoſe ſuffered, which under <hi>Moſes</hi> law dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy; and yet more, it ſhall be much ſorer, yea ſo much ſorer, as cannot be uttered, but is left to our conſideration to thinke, <hi>How much ſorer vengeance,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; and it muſt needs be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113533:14"/> ſuch, when the Lord himſelfe profeſſeth he will laugh at ſuch mens deſtruction, and mocke when their miſery comes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. And ſaith, that he will rejoyce over them in deſtroying of them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.63. No plagues like the plagues of ſuch as reject the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>If it be ſaid, that their mourning for him whom they pierced, was fulfilled in the repentance of thoſe <hi>Jewes</hi> mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. ſo as there is no further accompliſhment thereof to be looked for.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; This that is alledged cannot ſtand with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances expreſſed in the Text; for that mourning ſpoken of, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. is of ſuch a time in which God will be with <hi>Judah,</hi> and with the people of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in a ſpeciall manner, in the ſiege which ſhall be againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at which time, God will make <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> as an heavie ſtone to breake in pieces all the people of the earth that lift at it, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3.

But ſome may ſay, this that is ſpoken of building <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againe, may ſeeme to import, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall againe repoſſeſſe their own Land, which is but a vaine conceit.

They took thought for us, we being then that little ſiſter, and ſo let us doe for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is from them that the meanes of ſalvation is come to us, the Law is called <hi>their</hi> Law, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.34.

Many of thoſe dark Prophecies, which now lye hid in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſhall then be brought to light; the accompliſhment of them will then give us the interpretation.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>Thus we have heard the ſcope of theſe words, as they reſpect the <hi>Jewes</hi> in particular, to whom they were firſt ſpoken; let us now a little further conſider of them, as they concerne our ſelves. What was ſpoken of them, is appliable to all that are in the ſame eſtate with them; There is by nature but one eſtate of all men, whether Jewes or Gentiles, whether we ſpeake of ſin or miſery; thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is that what <hi>Eſay</hi> before ſpake of the diſpoſition and ſinne of the Jewes, in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.7, 8. the ſame doth the Apoſtle apply gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unto all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. As ſhewing thereby what is ſpoken of the ſin of one people, may be ſpoken of all, which are in the ſame naturall eſtate with them; there may be ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees both of ſin and miſery in ſeverall people, but the eſtate is the ſame in all. It was noted before, how the eſtate of the Jewes in their Babyloniſh captivitie, was applied to three other things, as types of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to the naturall eſtate of all men, who are in ſpirituall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as they were in outward:</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:113533:19"/>
               <p>Secondly, to the captivity of the Church under <hi>Antichriſt:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to the ſervile condition which the <hi>Jews</hi> are in.</p>
               <p>Now, theſe three are not things ſo different in nature, that they cannot ſometimes meet all together in one, they being but as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeverall degrees of one and the ſame naturall eſtate.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſome are meerly naturall, and no more, as not having gone ſo far, as to defile themſelves with the abominations of the Whore of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, others have proceeded further, and dallied with that Strumpet, and gone in unto her, and have drunk of the wine of her fornication.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, others have gone further then both the former, even to the execrable malice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo as to hate and maligne the ways of Chriſt, as the <hi>Jews</hi> do accurſe his name at this day. Now, whether we conſider one or other of theſe, they are all but ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees of the ſame eſtate of nature. And ſo there being but one eſtate of all men, therefore, what is truly ſaid of one, may be truly ſaid of all, only reſerving to each of them that particular degree of ſin or miſery, which is proper to them, but the ſame eſtate is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all. So that the <hi>Jews</hi> being for their ſin caſt off, and become priſonees in the pit, this their eſtate may fitly be applied to all men that are in the ſame naturall eſtate, excepting only the particular degree, as is before expreſſed; their heighth and excellency belong to them alone, and yet the ſame promiſes, in the ſubſtance of them, do belong unto all the faithfull: ſo it is concerning their ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which lies upon them; a particular degree thereof may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto them, but the ſame eſtate is common to all. So then, draw we unto our ſelves that which is here ſpoken of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then the ſumme of this Text is this, that even as they, ſo we, are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the priſon pit, till we be brought forth by the blood of the Covenant applied unto us. Let me explain the words a little, and ſo make way for the Obſervations:</p>
               <p>What is meant by the <hi>Pit</hi> here ſpoken of?</p>
               <p>So far as concernes the <hi>Jews,</hi> it notes out the preſent outward thraldome in which they are holden under the nations among which they live; as alſo that ſpirituall captivity in which they lie, being ſhut up under ſin and unbeliefe, as it is expreſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. And in this latter reſpect, it is common to us with them; we being
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113533:20"/> all of us captives under the dominion of our ſpirituall enemies, as well as they.</p>
               <p>What is the water here ſpoken of? the pit wherein there is no water? the idle toyes, and Frier-like conceits about Purgatory drawn from hence, I paſſe by, as not worthy ſpending time about them. Waters in Scripture, ſignifie two things; ſometimes they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie affliction, ſorrow, danger, trouble, and perplexity, as we may ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. and 69 1, 2. Sometimes again they are taken in a quite contrary ſenſe, ſignifying joy, comfort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.2. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. where the Lord compares him ſelf to a Fountain of living waters, which gives plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous refreſhing and conſolation. In this latter ſenſe it is taken here in this Text, for joy or comfort; ſo that the meaning is, that as the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo we, one and other of us, we are ſhut up as priſoners in the dungeon and pit of the priſon, where there is no water of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to refreſh our ſouls withall, we may finde dirt and mire there, in which we may ſtick faſt, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did, in his priſon, but there is no water of comfort to be found there. The looſing, or ſending forth of the pit, is the deliverance and freedome, which comes by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, called here, The blood of the Covenant: Firſt, becauſe it ratifieth the Covenant betwixt God and us, as we ſhall ſee afterwards. Secondly, becauſe the Covenant directs us to the blood of Chriſt to ſeek our freedome from it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having the ſenſe, we may in the words conſider theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The naturall eſtate of men, ſet forth in two degrees:
<list>
                     <item>1. We are priſoners in the pit, captives.</item>
                     <item>2. Deſtitute of all comfort, being in a pit wherein is no water.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The promiſe of deliverance, <hi>I have looſed,</hi> that is, <hi>will looſe; I will grant a deliverance;</hi> and this is ſet forth,</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the moving cauſe, namely, Gods free grace, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, but implyed in this, when it's ſaid, <hi>By thy covenant I will ſend forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> by that free goodneſſe and grace of mine, by which I firſt entred into a covenant with thee, and for thee, will I ſend thee deliverance out of this miſery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the meriting cauſe of it, <hi>The blood of the covenant,</hi> the blood of Chriſt; for though the deliverance be free to us, by free grace in reſpect of any thing done by us; yet it is obtained for us by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:113533:20"/>
               <p>From all together, obſerve theſe four things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are all naturally in a ſtate of bondage, as priſoners in the pit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſo long as we continue in this eſtate, nothing that we do enjoy, can give us any ſound comfort; there is no water in the pit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That though our condition be thus miſerable and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, yet there is both freedome from this bondage, and comfort to be obtained by the blood of the covenant; in Chriſt there is both an opening of the priſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o thoſe that are bound, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of living water, to refreſh the thirſty ſouls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That whatſoever ſalvation and deliverance God gives unto his people, in ſetting them free from this miſery, he doth it by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of, and according to his covenant. Theſe are the ſumme of all.</p>
               <p>Theſe four points the Text offers to our conſideration, all which, though handled publikely, and intended to have been publiſhed with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hich now comes forth; yet finding the Treatiſe to grow bigger then I thought in the beginning, I have now upon ſecond conſideration, reſolved to ſuppreſſe the three firſt obſervations, and to inſiſt only upon the fourth, as being that which is moſt pertinent to the preſent ſcope intended. The thing then which here we have now to conſider, is this, <hi>ſc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all the deliverances and ſalvation, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>4</label> which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to his people, he doth it by vertue of, and according to his Covenant. So in the Text, <hi>by the blood of thy Covenant I have,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not ſay by blood ſimply, but <hi>by the bood of the Covenant,</hi> becauſe the blood goes with the Covenant betwixt God and us. Hence it is, that we reade in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. when <hi>David</hi> looked at the <hi>Covenant</hi> which God had made with him, he makes <hi>that</hi> the ground and foundation of all the mercy and deliverance which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: Herein (ſaith he) is all my ſalvation, that <hi>God hath made with me a ſure Covenant.</hi> Conſider the truth of this point, both in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary deliverance, and ſpirituall ſalvations, (as the Text points at both, as we ſhewed before:) Firſt, concerning temporall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, ſee what God ſaith unto <hi>Noah,</hi> concerning his deliverance from the flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.18. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.1. <hi>With thee will I eſtabliſh my Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. and then God remembers <hi>Noah,</hi> and all that was with him in the Ark, and brought them to dry land again; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113533:21"/> was given him by covenant: See alſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. God promiſes to bring his people from under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, and why ſo? becauſe he remembred his Covenant with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: in <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.25.44, 45. The Lord tells them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. that if they ſinned againſt him, he would avenge upon them the quarrell of his Covenant, but yet in <hi>verſ.</hi> 44, 45. if they returned to him, he would remember <hi>the Covenant</hi> which he had made with them, and deliver them out of their captivity. Secondly, all ſpirituall ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is communicated by Gods Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.9. he ſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to his people, becauſe he was ever mindfull of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he <hi>commanded</hi> his Covenant for ever, as the word is there, <hi>i. e.</hi> he commanded it to ſtand faſt for ever: So in <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.17, 18. he will return and have compaſſion upon us, and forgive our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, what is the foundation of this? he will remember his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which he hath made with us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. that he might ſhew himſelf mindfull of his holy Covenant, therefore he ſent the Lord Jeſus to perform the work of redemption for his people: as in the beginning, when God firſt promiſed life to <hi>Adam,</hi> it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a covenant made with him, (though not the ſame that we muſt look for life by, (as we ſhall ſee more afterwards,) yet God made a covenant with him <hi>(Do this and live;)</hi> ſo it is now with us, it is by vertue of the Covenant, that we muſt expect life and ſalvation from Gods hand, the beginning of our ſalvation (which is begun in the firſt grace given to us in our converſion, and turning unto God) is given unto us according to the covenant begun with us in Chriſt, and the end of our ſalvation is according to the covenant which he makes with our ſelves, in our own perſons.</p>
               <p>The grounds and reaſons why the Lord taketh this courſe to convey life and bleſſedneſſe to us by covenant, are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> God doth herein wonderfully glorifie himſelf in the manifeſtation of his faithfulneſſe and truth, in keeping covenant with his people; God ſaith in Scripture ſometimes he will do this, or that, and you <hi>ſhall know</hi> that I am the Lord, <hi>Gods glory is in being known,</hi> Rom. 2.5. and 9.22.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113533:21"/> known Gods faithfulneſſe, and truth, if he had not entred into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with us. God might have ſhewed forth his power, mercy, and goodneſſe, without any promiſe or covenant, but his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe could not be known, and therefore ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 7.9. The Lord hath ſet his love upon you, and choſen you above any other people, that you might know he is the Lord, <hi>the faithfull God,</hi> &amp;c. therein God ſhewes his faithfulneſſe in performing his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with their fathers, by chooſing their ſeed to be a people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And the Apoſtle alſo, when he ſpeaks of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, attributes it to Gods truth and faithfulneſſe, in keeping covenant with their fathers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8, 9. It was <hi>mercy to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> (as he ſaith, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might glorifie God <hi>for his mercy</hi>) but it was <hi>truth and faithfulneſſe to the</hi> Jews; if he had never entred into covenant with us, he might have manifeſted mercy unto us, but he could never have made known his faitfulneſſe.</p>

This Covenant is expreſſed in Scripture,</p>
               <p>Firſt on the Fathers part, and here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a deſignation and appointment of Chriſt the Son, to the office of the Mediatorſhip, to be a means of bringing us back to God, and into a <hi>Covenant</hi> with him. Hence Chriſt is ſaid to be ſealed by the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. <hi>as marked out</hi> for ſuch a purpoſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. he was ordained in the counſell of the Father, before the foundation of the world; hence alſo ſaid to be choſen of the Father, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.1. noting out his deſignation to this work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a commandment from the Father to the Son, which he muſt ſubmit unto, and obey, thereby to effect the ſalvation of his people; he had a commandment what to teach and inſtruct them in, as the Prophet of the Church, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.49. He had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to enlighten the elect with the knowledge of the truth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7. to be a light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to open their eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A commandment alſo he had, to lay down his life for thoſe that are given unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. and to be tender over the Lambs, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them in his boſome, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a promiſe from the Father to the Son, the Father covenants with him: Firſt, to give him the Spirit in an abundant meaſure, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.1, 2. the Spirit ſhall reſt upon him: Secondly, he makes him a promiſe of aſſiſtance and help in this great work of our redemption, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.6. <hi>I will hold thy hand;</hi> what is the meaning of that? ſee <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.1. ſaith God of <hi>Cyrus, whoſe right hand I have holden,</hi> that is, I have ſtrengthened him to conquer the nations; ſo God promiſeth he will hold the hand of Chriſt, that though he met with ſtrong oppoſitions, yet he would ſtrengthen him with his power, that he ſhould not be diſcouraged, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.4. Thirdly, a promiſe of bleſſed ſucceſſe, that he ſhall not labour in vain, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10. he ſhall ſee his ſeed, the ſufferings of Chriſt, were <hi>dolores parturientis,</hi> as a woman with childe, though ſhe ſuffer many pains, yet ſhe ſees her childe at laſt; ſo ſhall Chriſt ſee many believing on his name, ſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.5. they are the words of promiſe made by the Father to the Son, that nations that know
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113533:23"/> him not, ſhould run unto him: Fourthly, a promiſe of rule and dominion, that he ſhall have dominion over all thoſe that are ſaved by him; this ſoveraignty and rule is promiſed to him in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40.10. The Lord Chriſt ſhall come with power, <hi>and his arm ſhall rule for him:</hi> and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.4. <hi>He ſhall ſet judgement in the earth, and the Iſles ſhall wait for his Law,</hi> to ſubmit themſelves unto it; and thence it's ſaid in <hi>Micah,</hi> 4.3. <hi>that he ſhall judge among many nations,</hi> &amp;c. that is, rule, order, command, and direct, as a Judge and Ruler among his people; the which promiſe is now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, all judgement being committed to the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22. Fiftly, a promiſe of glory to follow, and that, firſt to Chriſt himſelf, and then to the members of Chriſt; To Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.5. <hi>A nation ſhall run to thee, becauſe I have glorified thee;</hi> they are the words of God the Father to Chriſt the Son, promiſing to him glory, and ſuch glory as ſhould make the nations of the world run unto him: So alſo, to the members of Chriſt; there is a promiſe of glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, which promiſe was made known to Chriſt from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and Chriſt brings out that ſecret, out of the boſome of the Father, and reveals it to his Diſciples. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my Fathers pleaſure, to give you a kingdome;</hi> Chriſt knew the Fathers will, by the covenant paſſing between the Father and him, and this will of the Father, concerning the glory promiſed to them, Chriſt doth bring forth to light. Thus we ſee there is a covenant on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers part, now ſee it on Chriſts part; where,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an acceptation of the Office to which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Father, he did not take the Office of Mediatorſhip upon himſelf, but firſt the Father calls him unto it, and then the Son accepts it, and ſaith, <hi>Lo, I come,</hi> Hebr. 5.4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a promiſe on Chriſts part to depend and truſt upon the Father for help, according to the promiſe made by the Father: thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. the Apoſtle brings in Chriſt, promiſing confidence and affiance in the Father, I will truſt in him; and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> brings him in as looking for help from God, <hi>The Lord will help me,</hi> though I have many againſt me, (men and devils) yet the Lord will help me, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.7.9. he promiſes to wait upon his Father for ſupport and ſtrength: whereto agrees alſo that in <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 49.5. <hi>My God ſhall be my ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:113533:23"/>3. A promiſe of ſubmiſſion to his Fathers will, in bearing the reproaches and injuries that ſhould be done unto him; and to lay downe his life for thoſe that were given to him by the Father, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 50.5, 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. And according to all this which Chriſt thus covenanted with the Father, he was carefull to diſcharge the ſame, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.49, 50.</p>
               <p n="4">4. According to all this Covenant paſſed betwixt the Father and Chriſt, Chriſt expects the glory which was promiſed to himſelfe, and to his members. To himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. and to his members, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. He expects the accompliſhment of both from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thus farre then I grant a Covenant betwixt God the Father and Chriſt; and hence it is that God is called <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1.3. which is by reaſon of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt them; But if any ſhall hereupon conclude, that there is no Covenant paſſing betwixt God and <hi>us,</hi> then I ſay, they deny that which is as cleare in Scripture, as the Sunne ſhining at noone day. I may ſay of them, as the Apoſtle doth of ſome, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. that <hi>when they would be teachers, they underſtand not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirme.</hi> There is therefore a Covenant paſſing between God and man, which I will prove by theſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider thoſe expreſſe teſtimonies wherein mention is made of Gods Covenanting with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which muſt needs hold forth a Covenant between God and man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, leſt you forget the Covenant which the Lord hath made</hi> with you, <hi>&amp;c. Eſa.</hi> 55.1, 2, 3. where the Lord calls every one that thirſts after life, to come unto him: Theſe are called <hi>to enter into Covenant with God;</hi> but theſe ſpeeches cannot be applyed to Chriſt, but to us, that wee ſhould come to Chriſt, and through him make up an everlaſting Covenant betwixt God and us: ſee alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31. I will make a new Covenant <hi>with the houſe of Iſrael and Judah;</hi> and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37. (ſaith God) <hi>I will bring them into the bond of the Covenant;</hi> which places hold forth a Covenant between God and man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider more particularly ſuch teſtimonies as doe expreſſe Gods Covenant with ſundry particular Saints, as with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.18. and 17.2.4.7. and the ſame renewed to <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 26.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113533:24"/> 3. and confirmed to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 35.12. all mentioned together, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.42. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.5. I thinke that there is none ſo ſottiſh as to ſay, theſe perſons were Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Leſt any ſhould ſay, It's true, God makes a Covenant with us, but it is made with us, not in our perſons, but in Chriſt; Therefore in the third place, conſider ſuch Scriptures as doe not onely expreſſe a Covenant <hi>of God</hi> made <hi>with us,</hi> but a Covenant on <hi>our part</hi> made <hi>with God,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Call my Saints together, that make a Covenant with mee with ſacrifice;</hi> the Saints make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God. Hence we are ſaid, to <hi>paſſe into Covenant with the Lord,</hi> Deut. 29.12. as God for his part enters into Covenant with us, ſo doe we alſo with him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider thoſe places frequently uſed in Scripture, in which wee are ſaid ſometimes to <hi>keep Covenant,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 103.17, 18. Sometimes to <hi>tranſgreſſe and breake Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.14. and not to be <hi>faithfull in Covenant,</hi> Levit. 26.15. From which places I argue thus; Thoſe that either keepe or breake Covenant, thoſe are in Covenant, and doe make a Covenant with God, but wee are ſaid to breake or keepe Covenant; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider that the Covenant made with Chriſt concerning us, was made from everlaſting, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>&amp; Tit.</hi> 1.2. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made to Chriſt before the foundation of the world; but there is a Covenant alſo made in time, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.12. noted in theſe words <hi>(this day;)</hi> if there were no other Covenant between God and us, but what is made with Chriſt, then it cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d not be ſaid to be <hi>(to day)</hi> becauſe the Covenant made with Chriſt, was before the world was, and therefore the Covenant and promiſe that is made <hi>(to day)</hi> muſt needs be made with us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That Covenant of which Chriſt is the teſtator, muſt needs be a Covenant with us, elſe if the Covenant were made onely with Chriſt, then he muſt be both teſtator, and the partie to whom the Teſtament and Legacies are bequeathed, which is abſurd. Men doe not uſe to bequeath a teſtament to themſelves, but Chriſt is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the teſtator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. In the covenant between the Father and Chriſt, there he is a partie, not the teſtator, but in this he is the teſtator, therefore beſides the covenant between God and Chriſt, there is alſo a Covenant between God and us, and therefore the covenant is not made with Chriſt alone, but with us alſo.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:113533:24"/>7. A ſeventh argument may be taken from the paritie and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe between the covenant of works, and the covenant of grace, though there be great difference between them, as ſhall be ſhewed afterward, yet they agree in this, in that they are both made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſame parties, and perſons, between God and man; God made a covenant of workes with <hi>Adam,</hi> and that being broken, he comes and makes with him a new covenant of grace through Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall breake the ſerpents head;</hi> one of theſe covenants comes in the roome and ſtead of the other, and therefore the parties covenanting are the ſame; God and <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt covenant, the ſame God and the ſame <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond covenant.</p>
               <p n="8">8. From the end and uſe of the Sacraments, which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the covenant of grace, as being the ſeales of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. Now in reaſon, theſe two muſt goe together, the Covenant and the ſeale of it; It were a fond thing in a man to make a covenant with one, and to give the ſeales to another, they muſt have the ſeales, that have the covenant made with them, but the ſeales of the covenant (the Sacraments) are given to us; and therefore the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is made with us alſo.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If there be no promiſe or covenant made to us, (as ſome would have it) then infidelitie and unbeliefe is in us no ſinne; for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Where there is no law or commandement, there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion;</hi> ſo where there is no promiſe, there is no unbeliefe. When God promiſeth, and yet then wee believe not, this makes unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe a great ſinne, but if wee have no promiſe made unto us, then are wee not bound to believe; and ſo our not believing, is no ſinne.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The contrary doctrine is a doctrine tending to licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for as the covenant tends (as wee have heard) to bind us fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to God, to walke before him in obedience; ſo on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to ſay that there is no covenant between God and us, it opens a gap to looſneſſe of ſpirit: For if there be no covenant, then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a man be charged with unfaithfulneſſe to God, though he walk never ſo looſly, and therefore let ſuch men as broach ſuch tenents take heed, whileſt they teach ſuch libertie, they be not found to be the ſervants of corruption, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. Theſe are the arguments to prove, that there is a covenant between God and man.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Let us conſider how <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be conſidered of us, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the promiſe is made to Abraham.</hi> And to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113533:25"/> That he ſtands as a publick perſon, as the common parent of all the faithfull to the worlds end, he ſtands as one receiving the promiſe by faith, not onely for himſelfe, but for all that ſhould imitate him in his faith; he ſtands as a pattern and example of all the children of God, who are to be juſtified as he was. Hence it is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1. and <hi>ver.</hi> 12.16. he is called <hi>Abraham our father, the father of many Nations, the father of us all,</hi> namely, of all that doe believe. As <hi>Adam</hi> in the Covenant of workes, entered into that covenant, not onely for himſelfe, but for all his poſteritie; ſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> entered into the covenant of grace with God, as the father of all the faithfull that ſhould believe in Chriſt, as he did. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. he is ſaid to be <hi>the root,</hi> into which all the people of God are graffed. Now this conſideration gives us a little light, though it do not wholly cleare the doubt, helping to eſtabliſh us in the truth; for as <hi>Adam</hi> entring into Covenant with God for himſelfe, and his ſeed, they (that is, the ſeed) have thereby right to the promiſe of life by that Covenant, in caſe they fulfill the condition; ſo here, <hi>Abraham</hi> taking the Covenant of God for himſelfe, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the promiſe and bleſſing doth thereby belong to them alſo. As his faith deſcends downe to us as his children, ſo his bleſſing conveyed by the promiſe, deſcends downe upon us alſo. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>They that are of faith, are bleſſed with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider what ſeed, or ſeeds <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to be father to, and there is a double ſeed of his mentioned in Scripture; Firſt, A carnall naturall ſeed, according to the fleſh, proceeding from him by naturall generation, but ſtill remaining in unbeliefe. And in this ſenſe Chriſt ſpeakes to theſe wicked unbelieving <hi>Jewes,</hi> which went about to kill him, acknowledging them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.37. meaning in reſpect of the fleſhly generation, and yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. he denies them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children; <hi>for then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if yee were Abrahams children, yee would doe the workes of Abraham;</hi> implying that they were not the children of the promiſe, therefore ſeeing <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt have a ſeed to inherite the promiſe, and they were not the ſeed; therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt have another ſeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the fleſhly or naturall ſeed.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſecondly, There is a ſpirituall ſeed, that walke in the faith and ſteps of the faith and obedience of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal. 37.29.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113533:26"/> And theſe are counted for the ſeed; according to that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. they <hi>are not all Iſrael that are of Iſrael,</hi> proceeding from him by naturall generation, <hi>theſe</hi> are not counted for the true ſeed; there is therefore a ſpirituall ſeed beſide the carnall; this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſhewes clearly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22.28, 29. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Abraham had two ſonnes, the one by a bond woman, the other by a free woman; Iſhmael</hi> the ſonne of the bond woman, borne after the fleſh, with all thoſe that are like unto him, looking for righteouſneſſe by the Law, are the carnall ſeed. Againe, <hi>Iſaac</hi> borne by promiſe, with all thoſe that looke, as he did, for righteouſneſſe and ſalvation by faith in the promiſe, they are the ſpirituall ſeed. Now mark, the promiſe is made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his <hi>ſeed, not ſeeds,</hi> that is, not to both ſeeds, both carnall and ſpirituall, but onely to the one, which is the ſpirituall; that is, the promiſe of life is not made to that carnall ſeed which looks for life by the works of the Law, but to that ſeed onely, which looks for it by the promiſe. See how it was between <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> when God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he made it not with both his ſonnes, but onely with one of them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19. <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>Iſaac. Iſhmael</hi> had ſome bleſſings caſt in upon him for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. but the Covenant was eſtabliſhed upon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the ſeed of promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.21.</p>
               <p>As it is thus in the type, ſo in the antitype, Gods covenant is not made with thoſe that are as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> which are borne after the fleſh, and ſeek for life by the works of the Law; but with thoſe that are as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the children of the promiſe, and ſeeke for ſalvation by faith in Chriſt, thoſe onely are counted for the true ſeed. And thus it is but one ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> which the promiſe is made unto.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> Here then comes in the third thing to be conſidered; conſider how the name <hi>Chriſt</hi> is taken in Scripture, and that is two wayes; Firſt, Perſonally; Secondly, Myſtically.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Perſonally, and that moſt uſually, as in thoſe places; <hi>A Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt the Lord; In Chriſt are all the promiſes yea and amen; There is one Mediatour between God and man, the man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Myſtically, not for Chriſts perſon alone, but for the whole body of the faithfull united to Chriſt, and ſo it is taken, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. where the Apoſtle having ſpoken of the ſeverall gifts powred
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113533:26"/> upon the members of the Church, ſaith, <hi>As many members make one both, ſo is Chriſt;</hi> that is, (according to all Expoſitors) the body of Chriſt, the faithfull that are knit to him by faith, and it cannot be taken otherwiſe, and ſo it is taken here in this place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. Marke then, there is Chriſt myſticall as well as Chriſt perſonall; And Chriſt myſticall, being the whole company of the faithfull, are this one ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which the promiſe is made, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the carnall ſeed, which ſeeke for righteouſneſſe by the law, which have no part in the promiſe.</p>
               <p>But how may it appeare (will ſome ſay) that this is the Apoſtles meaning; that the name of Chriſt is ſo to be taken in this place, for Chriſt myſticall?</p>
               <p n="4">4. To cleare this therefore marke the next point, namely, the order how the promiſe is made to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeed ſpoken of, cometh to partake of the promiſe; And that is thus; The promiſe is made firſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and then to his ſeed, to <hi>Abraham</hi> at firſt hand, and to his ſeed as ſecond in order from <hi>Abraham; Abraham</hi> is the root, his ſeed are as the branches, and therefore this ſeed being ſuch a ſeed as cometh to have right to the promiſe, as ſecond in order from <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore this cannot be Chriſt perſonall, but myſticall, for Chriſt perſonall doth not come to have right to the promiſe from <hi>Abraham,</hi> but rather <hi>Abraham</hi> from Chriſt. Some more reaſons to confirme this interpretation, you ſhall ſee afterwards.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Adde hereto the conſideration of the Apoſtles ſcope and matter which he hath in hand, and ſee whether this interpretation doe not agr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e with that alſo; The ſcope then which the Apoſtle aymes at, is to prove that wee are juſtified not by the works of the Law, but onely by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and that whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him, whether Jewes or Gentiles, are iuſtified by him, there being but one way of life for both people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.29, 30. Now this one propoſition, (that all both Jewes and Gentiles are juſtified onely by faith in Chriſt) though it be but one compleat truth, yet it ſtands of three branches or parts contained in it; for, firſt, there is in it, faith the inſtrument; ſecondly, Chriſt the object; thirdly, Jewes and Gentiles the ſubject to be juſtified: and though no one of theſe is in any part of the Apoſtles diſcourſe excluded, yet in ſome paſſages he drives more eſpecially at ſome one of them, and in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113533:27"/> other paſſages at another; as for example, Chap. 3.5, 6, 7. here he ſpeakes more eſpecially of faith, the inſtrument and meanes of our juſtification; ſometimes againe he poynts more particularly at the ſubject, or perſons to be juſtified; as in <hi>ver.</hi> 8.14. mentioning the Gentiles; ſometimes he aymes eſpecially at Chriſt the object of our faith, as <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uſe the promiſe of bleſſedneſſe was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, with reſpect to Chriſt, as being one with Chriſt, and no otherwiſe; ſo that when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The promiſe is made to one ſeed, which is Chriſt;</hi> his meaning is as if he ſhould have ſaid, Whether they be Jewes or Gentiles th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t believe in Chriſt, and are one with him by faith, they are alike partakers of the bleſſing, becauſe the promiſe is made to men, as they are Chriſts, and as they become one with him by faith.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Apoſtle ſaw that ſome others might ſtill object, that though it was thus before the Law, that men ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, yet after the Law given, there was a new way of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſhewed, namely by the workes of the Law.</p>
               <p>To this the Apoſtle anſwers, No; and gives a double reaſon of his deniall; Firſt, That the Covenant or Teſtament of God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, no man may adde or alter any thing therein, therefore much more is Gods Covenant unalterable, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Covenant was confirmed before in reſpect of Chriſt, or with reſpect to Chriſt, and onely to that ſeed which is by faith
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:113533:27"/> made one with Chriſt, and therefore being made to that ſeed only which is Chriſts, and with reſpect unto Chriſt; it cannot be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled without diſreſpect and wrong doing unto Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 16. And hereto agrees that which follows, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. that the covenant was confirmed before with reſpect to Chriſt, Chriſt is the bond of the covenant betwixt God and us, ſo as if that covenant which God hath made with reſpect unto Chriſt, ſhould be broken and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, it could not but be a neglect caſt upon Chriſt himſelf; but this cannot be, therefore the covenant made with reſpect unto Chriſt, and made with that ſeed which is Chriſts, and one with him, muſt needs ſtand faſt, and never be diſanulled.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſee, how the taking of (Chriſt) for Chriſt myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, agreeth both with o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her Scriptures, and with the ſcope of the Apoſtle in this place; and therefore, when they ſay the promiſe is made to Chriſt only, and therefore not to us, I ſay it follows not it is to Chriſt only, and yet to us alſo, becauſe it is to Chriſt myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and not to Chriſt perſonall. And when they ſay it is to one ſeed, therefore not to us, being many. I anſwer, it followes not, if by many, they underſtand many perſons, the perſons of all the faithfull making up but one ſpirituall ſeed, as the whole number of thoſe that ſeek righteouſneſſe by the Law, do make but one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thus much I grant; firſt, that all the promiſes are made to Chriſt only, (even to Chriſt perſonall, in this ſenſe, if men mean to Chriſt, that is, with reſpect to Chriſt, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. and that in him they are <hi>yea and Amen,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. But this doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but they are made to us alſo, they being in and through him confirmed to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I adde more, that thoſe promiſes which do concern us, are not only made to us through Chriſt, but they are made firſt to Chriſt in our behalf, before they are made to us, becauſe all the whole work of our redemption and ſalvation was tranſacted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son before the foundation of the world, and is afterwards revealed to us in due time, as is evident, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. But this doth not hinder but that the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is afterwards in time made to us alſo: Look as it is in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants among men, while the childe is yet unborn, the father takes conveyance of an Inheritance for him, which he keeps in his own
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113533:28"/> hand till the childe be born, and comes to yeers, and then he puts it into his own poſſeſſion; ſo it is here, we are for a time hid in the womb of Gods election, till we be brought forth by the grace of regeneration, during which time, we are not in our ſelves capable of receiving any promiſe of life made to us, but it is made to Chriſt in our behalf, and he receives the promiſe from the Father in our ſtead; but yet ſo, that when we come to be born anew, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made unto our ſelves, and we are put into poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I grant there are ſome promiſes made to Chriſt, not only in our be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Before I proceed to Uſe, I will adde two or three Reaſons more, to cleer this interpretation, that this ſeed is meant of Chriſt myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, not perſonall:</p>
               <p>Frſt, one was named before; becauſe it is ſuch a ſeed as comes to have right to the promiſe, as ſecond in order from <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider next, that when God ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed;</hi> look what ſeed is there meant, the ſame is meant in this place of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> chap. 3.16. Now, what ſeed is meant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. the Apoſtle expounds <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7. They that are of the faith, are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. they that are Chriſts, they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113533:28"/> Chriſt, but thoſe that are Chriſts, are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and heirs by promiſe; theſe therefore are the ſeed to whom the promiſe is made.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle in this place of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch a promiſe, as whereby a ſinner ſhould receive juſtification, and forgiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ification, and ſhews how a ſinner comes to partake of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of life, and righteouſneſſe, therefore he muſt needs ſpeak of ſuch a ſeed as ſtands in need of juſtification and righteouſneſſe, which do moſt properly agree to the faithfull.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thly, the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of two Teſtaments, one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the other, one diſanulling the other, from which I reaſon thus; look to whom the latter Teſtament of the Law was given, unto them was the firſt covenant or teſtament of grace given; now the latter teſtament, or covenant of the Law, was given to all the faithfull ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for ſaith the Apoſtle, it is a Scool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to bring them to Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. therefore to them alſo was the former teſtament or promiſe given. That ye may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcern the force of this reaſon, conſider how the Apoſtle in treating of juſtification, delivers this heavenly doctrine; that a ſinner is juſtified by faith alone in Chriſt, without works. Now hee makes an objection; True, might ſome ſay, before the giving of the Law, juſtification was by free promiſe, but when the Law was given, then there was another way of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication appointed, at leaſt to joyn works with the promiſe; and the former way of juſtification by free grace was diſanulled by the latter, that is, the bringing in of the Law; here is the force of the objection.</p>
               <p>Now, if we ſhall conceive the promiſe was made to one ſeed, and the covenant of the Law given to another, and not both of them to the ſame ſeed, then there is no colour of reaſon in the Apoſtles objection; for if the promiſe of Grace was given to one ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, to Chriſt perſonall, and the covenant of the Law given to another ſeed, then one need not diſanull the other, but they may both ſtand together; for if a man make two different covenants with two ſeverall perſons, they may both ſtand, the one not impeaching the other; but here is the ſtrength of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is ſuppoſed, that the two covenants are made with the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113533:29"/> ſame perſons, and then there is ſome ſeeming appearance of one diſanulling the other; therefore the ſtrength of the objection infers cleerly, that both the promiſe of Grace, and covenant of the Law, was made to the ſame perſons, to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which are the children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Thus this objection is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and the doctrine confirmed; that whatſoever ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

When <hi>Abraham</hi> heard that God would enter into covenant with him, <hi>Abraham</hi> falls upon his face before the Lord; as firſt wondering, and being aſtoniſhed to heare and think of ſuch a favour: Secondly, abaſed in himſelf, as unworthy to touch the hand of the high God, to make up the covenant with him, he was abaſed in himſelf, to ſee the Lord ſo abaſing himſelf for his ſake: Thirdly, he falls upon his face, as thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the grace offered: Fourthly, readily ſubmitting himſelf to the Lords good pleaſure &amp; will, as one content to lie down at Gods feet, ſubmitting to the loweſt conditions, to do any thing, believe any thing, ſo that he might be partaker of this priviledge, to be in covenant with the great God: See alſo how this affected <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who am I, O Lord?</hi> &amp;c. And hence it is, that the Lord mentions this as of his ſpeciall favour, which he vouchſafed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. that he entred into covenant with them, whereby they became his people; let us therefore herein ſee the abundant goodneſſe of God to us.

That this is the meaning, conſider the ſame kinde of expreſſion in other places, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.18. the Prophet ſpeaking of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> ſaith, he had broken the covenant, though he had given the hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he broke the covenant which he had made by giving his hand: So <hi>Ezra,</hi> 10.3.9. when the people reformed and entred into a covenant, they gave their hands that they would put away their ſtrange wives.

               <p n="1">1. Break your covenant with your old ſins, and your luſts, or elſe God will not enter into covenant with you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24. you cannot ſerve two maſters; theſe are ſo contrary, that ſo long as you are in league with ſin and the world, you cannot enter into covenant with God, take away the matter of provocation, which at firſt brake the covenant between God and you, and then there is one ſtep made for your entering into covenant with him. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thine own heart, what is that which maintains the breach between God and thee, and makes God a ſtranger to thee, and put that away, though never ſo gainfull, never ſo pleaſing a ſin, without this, God will never enter into covenant with thee; thou canſt not be in covenant with thy ſin and God together, therefore breake thy covenant with ſin, if thou deſire to be in covenant with God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Go before the Lord as guilty of thy former rebellion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe in breaking covenant with him, and judge thy ſelf for it, lay down thy ſelf and life before God, confeſſing and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that it were juſt, if he ſhould deſtroy thee; condemn thy ſelf for thy former rebellion againſt him, ſubmit thy ſelf to the good pleaſure of his will, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Here I am, let him do with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113533:30"/> me as ſeemes good in his eyes;</hi> put thy life into the mercifull hands of God, either to take it from thee, or to give it to thee again, ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, If thou wilt ſave me, thou ſhalt ſhew abundant grace, if thou wilt deſtroy me, thou art juſt; go before God with this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſubmiſſion, and ſeek peace from him, go and put thy rope about thy neck, like <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants, and confeſſe thy own guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe; without this, God will never enter into covenant with thee, God will have thee know, thou muſt take thy life as a free gift of grace, and that thou ſtandeſt at his mercy either to ſave thee or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Come with an humble ſubmiſſion to yeeld up thy ſelf to the obedience of the will of God; wee muſt receive him from the law of our life by which we muſt live. When you come to make a covenant with God, you muſt not come to give lawes unto God, but to take lawes from God, not to impoſe lawes upon him; that he ſhall ſave you ſo and ſo, but you muſt leave God free to make the conditions of the covenant after his own minde and will; think it honour enough that you may be a people in covenant with God, and have your life granted by covenant from him, but for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, leave them to God, let him command and require what he will, he muſt be free, or elſe he will not make a covenant with you: This is that which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> exhorted to, to come and give the hand to the Lord, <hi>and ſerve him,</hi> we muſt come and make a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, <hi>as a ſervant with his maſter,</hi> as <hi>Subjects</hi> with their <hi>Prince,</hi> a covenant of ſervice, not to be our own Lords, the ſons of <hi>David,</hi> and princes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> (when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſate upon the Throne) came and gave the hand unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.24. they made a covenant with him, but it was with ſubmiſſion to his power, ſuch is the covenant which we muſt make with God, we muſt give the hand under God, ſubmitting to him, to be ruled by him. Thence it is, that we are called upon to deny our ſelves; <hi>If any one will be my diſciple, let him deny himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. we muſt not cleave to our ſelves, to our wills, and make our own Lawes, we muſt deny our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, wills and affections, refuſe to be governed by them, and reſign up our ſelves to the will of God; this is the reſolution we muſt come unto, if we will enter into covenant with God, as it was in the ſacrifice of the Law, he that offered it, laid his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of it, as dedicating it to God, and quitting it from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113533:31"/> himſelf, as if he ſhould ſay, I have no more to do with this bullock, it is now the Lords, (that was in part the ſignification of that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſo if we will be the Lords people in covenant with him, we muſt reſigne our ſelves only and wholly to be for him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, 2. we mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. If we would enter into covenant with God, we muſt come before him in the name of a Mediator, that is, the Lord Jeſus, in the mediation of his ſacrifice we muſt offer up to the Lord a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for all our treacherous rebellion againſt him, in that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice we muſt come and ſeek reconciliation, and the renewing of our covenant with God, without ſuch a ſacrifice, whereby Gods juſtice may be ſatisfied, there is no hope of a covenant to be made between God and you: As in the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.1. to 8. they come and ſacrifice, and ſo the covenant is made between God and them. Now theſe were types of Chriſts ſacrifice, come therefore ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, and ſay, Lord, here is the blood of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which maketh ſatisfaction for my rebellion, and in this blood enter into covenant with me. They that make a covenant with God, do it by ſacrifice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. And therefore in the mediation of Chriſts blood, and by faith in it look for a re-union and knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God and us together.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After all this, that you have broken your covenant with your ſins, judged your ſelves for them, ſubmitted your ſelves to the will of God, and come in the name of a Mediator, then by faith look at the gracious invitation of God, and conſider his readineſſe and willingneſſe to enter into covenant with you, though there be an infinite diſparity between the God of glory and us, yet he is pleaſed to invite us to make a covenant with him; if you ſeek to him, he will not turn away his face from you, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaith to the people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.8, 9. though he might turn away from you in wrath and diſpleaſure, yet he will not, but will enter into a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:113533:31"/> gracious Covenant with you; <hi>He that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt off,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. In that manner therefore goe thou and humble thy ſelfe before God, confeſſe thy treachery and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and looke at God as having a golden ſcepter in his hand, and intreat him to enter into a Covenant with thee, and ſubmit thy ſelfe wholly to be at his command, plead the promiſe of his grace, touch the top of the ſcepter, and take hold of the Covenant, and then certainly in time the Lord will ſpeake to thy ſoule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by the teſtimony of his Spirit, that he will be a God unto thee, and take thee to be one of his people. Thus you ſee the way to enter into Covenant with God.</p>

If wee ſhall againe breake this ſecond covenant with him, wee ſhall not onely miſſe of that ſalvation and life which wee hope for, but we ſhall periſh with a double deſtruction, wee ſhall pay for all our treachery and unfaithfulneſſe in this Covenant. This concernes <hi>us</hi> to looke unto more then any people in the world, let us not breake Covenant with God twice.

When the Saints ſometimes thinke of the greatneſſe of the promiſes, on the one ſide, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their owne povertie and vileneſſe, the low and undone condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have brought themſelves into by their ſins on the other ſide, the promiſes ſeeme to them to be above hope and faith. As the Sunne dazles the eye to looke upon ſo glorious a light, ſo the great things which God hath promiſed in his Covenant, doe even dazle the eye of faith, and they thinke them almoſt impoſſible, that they ſhould have ſuch neare communion with God, and be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that everlaſting happineſſe, &amp;c. Theſe doe even ſet faith it ſelfe at a ſtand, therefore looke at the ſtabilitie of the promiſe of God, he hath paſſed over thoſe things by covenant, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a covenant-breaker, his covenant ſtandeth faſter then the mountaines that cannot be moved, and therefore as long as they are not above the promiſe and covenant of God, neither let them be above our faith and hope, onely let us wait for them in the way of faith and obedience. It's ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. <hi>All the pathes of the Lord are mercy and truth, to them that keepe his Covenant.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.9. <hi>Faithfull is he that hath called you to the fellowſhip of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe is that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 7.12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe but enter into covenant with God, and keepe it with him, and then be confident of all that rich bleſſing which the Lord hath promiſed to his people. There is a promiſe made to Chriſt, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 49.7. that though he was deſpiſed of men, and abhorred of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and contemned by the rulers, yet (though it was very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reaſon) Kings and Princes ſhould bow downe to him, and worſhip him. But how ſhall this be brought to paſſe? this ſhall be done, ſaith the Text, <hi>becauſe of the Lord that is faithfull.</hi> So though
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113533:32"/> we be poore wormes, yet the Lord hath promiſed to us life and glory, and a Kingdome; But can this be accompliſhed to ſuch as we be? Yes, becauſe of the faithfulneſſe of God, who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and undertaken to performe it. Therefore if God have made thee mindfull and carefull of his covenant, to walke in obedience to him, then know that the Lord is more mindfull of his owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with thee, to performe to thee all that mercy and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which he hath promiſed to thee; and let this be a pledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee of the accompliſhment of all, even the care that God hath put in thy heart to walke in Covenant with him. Thus wee have heard the fourth generall obſervation, noted out of the Text. But now by occaſion thereof, wee will lanch a little further into the deepe, having ſailed by the ſhore all this while, and enter into a conſideration more particularly of the nature of that Covenant, by which God conveyes life and ſalvation to his people.</p>
               <p>There are two covenants which the Scripture makes mention of, one of workes, the other of grace; of both the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.23, 24. The one is the Teſtament or Covenant of the Law, that ſhuts up all under wrath, the other of grace, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes libertie; the one is uſually called the commandement, the other the promiſe; the one is contained in the Law, the other in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now if it be demanded, what covenant it is by which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates ſalvation to us:</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it is the covenant of grace, and not the covenant of workes, by which the bleſſing of life and ſalvation cometh.</p>
               <p>For the more diſtinct handling whereof, wee muſt conſider theſe two things ſeverally.</p>

               <p>Secondly, To ſhew that the Lord communicates his ſalvation by the covenant of grace, and not of workes.</p>
               <p>Concerning the former, that wee may diſcerne what is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Covenant of grace; this I will ſet forth by conſidering theſe five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By comparing the covenant of grace with the covenant of workes; ſhewing both wherein they are alike, &amp; wherein they differ.</p>

               <p n="5">5. By noting out the properties of the Covenant.</p>

               <p n="1">1. They agree in the author of them; God is the author of both Covenants, even the ſame God.

               <p n="2">2. They agree in the parties contracting and making covenant together, both of them are made with us, God and man are the parties covenanting in both Covenants, not as if one (the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes) were made with us, the other (the covenant of grace) were made onely with Chriſt, but both are made with us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They agree in one common end, which is, that God may be glorified in his creature, in the manifeſtation either of his juſtice or mercy, according to the nature of the Covenant made with him, the glorifying of God is the common end of both.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They agree in this, that in both there is a promiſe of life and bleſſedneſſe; the covenant of workes ſaith, <hi>Doe this and live;</hi> the covenant of grace ſaith, <hi>Believe and live;</hi> Life is promiſed in both; Now whether the ſame life be promiſed in both, or whether a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene felicitie and life here on earth, be promiſed in the one, and an heavenly in the other, as ſome thinke, or whether a heavenly life and glory in both, as ſome others thinke, I will not determine, it not being much materiall; It's enough to know that life and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was and is promiſed in both.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Whether workes be not required in the covenant of grace. If both theſe be required, faith in the Covenant of workes, and workes in the covenant of grace; then how ſtands the difference between the two Covenants?</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> For anſwer to the firſt; when it is demanded whether faith be not required in the Covenant of workes.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is; but firſt, it is not the ſame faith; ſecondly, nor required for the ſame end, as in the Covenant of grace. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine this, I ſay, the Covenant of workes requires faith, and that in a threefold act thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of dependance upon God, the fountaine and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all good, wee were not in our firſt and beſt being which wee had by creation, wee were not (I ſay) ſo perfect, but wee ſtood in need ſtill to depend upon him that had created us, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that being which he had given us. It is imprinted in the nature of every creature to depend for ſuſtentation upon that from whence it had its beginning; as the chicken upon the hen, &amp;c. So the whole creation lookes backe unto him that made it for preſervation in their being, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.21.27. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 145.15. And if it be ſo in theſe unreaſonable creatures, thus to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Creator, then was the ſame in man much more; the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Law required this faith of man in the beginning, though now we be as Gods in our owne eyes, ſelfe-ſufficient, depending
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113533:34"/> upon our ſelves, and none elſe, for all the good wee hope for; yet at the beginning it was not ſo. But man was to depend upon God for his being, and well-being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another act of faith required in the Law, was a perſwaſion that God was well pleaſed with him, whilſt he walked in the way of love and obedience to his creator, he was to believe without feare and doubt, that ſo long as he obeyed the will of the Lord, he was well-pleaſed with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He was to believe the bleſſing of life promiſed in that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to expect it according to the promiſe. In all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards faith was commanded in the Covenant of workes.</p>
               <p>It may here be demanded; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> If faith be required in the covenant of workes, why is it not expreſſed in plaine words, as well as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? the Covenant of workes ſaith; <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, and ſerve him;</hi> but it doth not call for any act of faith at all.</p>
               <p>The reaſon thereof is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> becauſe when the Covenant of workes was made with man, he was then in his integritie, ſinne was not yet come into the world, and therefore there was no cauſe for man to doubt of Gods love, and acceptation of him. But having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo great benefits from God, made after his image, but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the Angels, and having dominion given him over all the workes of Gods hands, he was now to be put in minde of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards his creator, and therefore was to be ſtirred up to love, honour and obey him, no need was there to ſtirre him up to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Gods goodneſſe towards him, of which he had no cauſe to doubt. But when God cometh to make a Covenant of grace with man, he finds him in his ſin and rebellion, full of feares and doubts, and therefore had need to be encouraged to believe that God will be reconciled; but then it was not ſo, there was then nothing to cauſe diſtruſt, and therefore faith was not expreſſed in that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet faith was then required, as wee have ſhewed, though <hi>not the ſame faith</hi> that is required in the covenant of grace. But they differ in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The covenant of workes commandeth faith in God as a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to preſerve our being, but not as a redeemer to deliver us from miſery. <hi>Adam</hi> was not bound to believe on God as a redeemer; for then he needed no redemption. But the Covenant of grace, requires faith in God as a redeemer; redeeming us from ſinne and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113533:35"/> miſery. The <hi>Jewes</hi> profeſſed they believed on God, but by what faith? When the faith of the Goſpel was preached unto them by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, they counted it a ſtrange thing, they clave to the Covenant of workes, they therefore believed on God as a Creator, but believed not on grace revealed in the Goſpel; by this faith they believed not on him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant of workes required faith to believe in God loving mee, as created holy, and continuing in the ſame puritie and holineſſe before him, and no further; but the Covenant of grace commands faith to believe in God loving us, and pitying us loſt ſinners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The faith required in the Covenant of workes, was mutable, as now all the righteouſneſſe required in that Covenant, and ſo might be loſt, as afterwards it was by the ſinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> but the faith required in the Covenant of grace, is ſuch as is begotten of an immortall ſeed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. and therefore cannot be loſt, but abide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and continues for ever; It is a faith that cannot faile, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Thus yee ſee the ſame faith is not required in both Covenants; Secondly, It is not required in the Covenant of grace for the ſame end as it was in the Covenant of workes; In the Covenant of workes, faith was required as a part of that righteouſneſſe which the Law required, it is one of the duties of the Law; but in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace it is required not as any part of our righteouſneſſe, but onely as an inſtrument to receive and apprehend the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is wrought for us by Chriſt; and therefore the faith required in the Covenant of workes, was a giving unto God, but the faith required in the Covenant of grace, is onely a receiving from God, that which he freely offers us.</p>

                  </label> 
                  <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation,</hi> teacheth us to be zealous of <hi>good workes;</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let men ſee your good workes,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; though Chriſt preached not a Covenant of workes, but of grace, yet he calls for good workes. But marke the difference.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covenant of workes doth not require workes for the ſame end, as the Covenant of grace, for that requires workes as the matter of our juſtification before God; ſo ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding him in a Legall way) <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. laſt, <hi>This is your righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> but the Covenant of grace requires workes not as a part of our righteouſneſſe, but that thereby wee ſhould glorifie God, and manifeſt it that wee are made righteous by Chriſt, <hi>James</hi> 2. wee are thereby declared to be righteous; the godly converſation of a Chriſtian maketh it evident to the conſciences of men, that he is a juſtified man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The workes that are required in the Covenant of grace, are not required from the ſame beginning; the Covenant of workes requires workes to be performed from our own ſtrength and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie received in the Creation, it preſuppoſeth abilitie in our ſelves to doe what it requireth. But the Covenant of grace requireth workes to be done by the help of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can doe all things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>through Chriſt ſtrengthning mee,</hi> that is, the power which the Covenant of grace directs us unto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Covenant of grace doth not require works in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as the Covenant of workes doth, for the Covenant of workes requires workes firſt, and then faith to believe our ſelves beloved unto life; but the Covenant of grace requireth faith firſt, and then that we bring forth good workes; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle (<hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Let them which have believed, be carefull to ſhew forth good workes:</hi> He doth not ſay, Let them which have done good workes, believe; but firſt believe and then doe good workes, he placeth faith before workes; and hence it is that the obedience of the Goſpel, is called <hi>the obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26. as following faith and ſpringing from it. Thus then this difference of the condition of the Covenants remaineth; the one Covenant commanding workes, the other faith.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Differ. </seg>2</label> The ſecond maine difference is this, namely, that the Covenant of workes is made without a Mediator, to mediate between God and man. But in the Covenant of grace there is a Mediator com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between, to unite God and man together, and make them one. Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. Chriſt is called <hi>the Mediator of the new Teſtament;</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. but the firſt Covenant of workes had no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The reaſon of this difference is, becauſe when God came to make a covenant of workes with <hi>Adam,</hi> then there was no diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between God and man, man was yet righteous, perſiſting in that innocency and righteouſneſſe in which he was created, there was yet no breach made, the heart and mind of man anſwering to the mind of God, and therefore there was no need of a Mediator to bring them together; But when the Covenant of grace is made with man, there is a former breach between God and him, and ſo there is need of a third partie, of a Mediator to make them one. Hence is that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>A Mediator is not a Mediator of one;</hi> whiles wee are one with God, there is no need of a Mediator, no more then there is need for one to mediate between a man and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, (this is the ordinary interpretation of that place, though it may probably beare another ſenſe) and ſo it was betwixt God and man in the beginning, there was no variance then between them by ſinne, then God made a Covenant with man, as with his friend, as <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>the friend of God,</hi> but when ſin had made a breach between God and man, then ſtrangeneſſe and enmitie followed, God is eſtranged from us, and wee are enemies unto God, ſo that without a Mediator, wee can never come to be united into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant againe. Now man feares and trembles to come before God, and God being offended, cannot be at peace, unleſſe his Juſtice be ſatisfied; Therefore when <hi>Adam</hi> had once ſinned, he feared to come
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:113533:36"/> into the preſence of God, and hid himſelfe, till God revealed and made knowne to him the Mediator of the Covenant, that <hi>the Seed of the woman ſhould breake the Serpents head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenant of workes was delivered to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> by the hand of a Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> and ſo the difference is taken away.</p>
               <p>I grant the Covenant of workes was then revealed and made <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> knowne to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as being before almoſt oblitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and blotted out of mans heart, and therefore God renewed the knowledge of the Covenant of workes to them.</p>
               <p>I grant alſo that the Law was given to them by the mediation <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was a mediator betwixt God and them.</p>
               <p>But I adde withall, that the Law though it containe the ſumme <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> of the Covenant of workes, yet was not delivered unto that people for this end, to ſtand between God and them as a Covenant of workes, by which they ſhould be juſtified and live, but onely as it was ſubſervient and helpfull unto them, to attaine the end of the former Covenant of grace, which God had made with them in their fathers, God had promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to be a God to him, and to his ſeed, but now the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> having been long trained up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong an ignorant and Idolatrous people, they little knew what need they had to flie to the promiſe of grace, and therefore the Lord now reveales his Law to them in that manner, to make them ſee by the terrors of the Law, that they cannot come neare unto God thereby; this was the Lords end in giving the Law unto them, and not to ſtand between God and them as a Covenant of life, by which they ſhould live. This is evident by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the Law?</hi> The Apoſtle had before proved that wee are juſtified by faith in the free promiſe, and not by workes; ſome then might object, Why was the Law then given to the children of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> The Apoſtle anſwers, it was given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine tranſgreſſion, to convince men of ſin, and to be as a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to bring them to Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. Theſe then were the ends of giving the Law; 1. That the knowledge of ſinne might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 19, 20. The Law entred that ſinne might abound, that is, the knowledge of it, that man might know his ſinne; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To lead them to Chriſt; Thirdly, To reſtraine the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and ſinne of man, and to keepe them in obedience. But not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:113533:37"/> (as I ſaid) to ſtand in the forme of a Covenant, for them to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſaved thereby.</p>
               <p>The Law is to be conſidered two wayes; Firſt, Abſolutely, and by it ſelfe, as containing a Covenant of workes: Secondly, Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and with reſpect to the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Abſolutely, alone by it ſelfe, and ſo it was given as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning, and ſo conſidered, it ſhews the way and meanes of life, by which wee might live.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reſpectively, as having reference to the Covenant of grace, and ſo it was given to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> both as antecedent and conſequent thereto.

And thus was it given unto them.</p>
               <p>And here becauſe ſome may doubt of this truth, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay downe ſome grounds to confirme it, and to make it cleare, that the Covenant made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was not a Covenant of workes.</p>

But the falſe Apoſtles urged it as a worke of the Law, as a dutie and worke to be done neceſſary to juſtification and ſalvation. Now the Apoſtle in ſaying that <hi>if they were circumciſed, they were bound to keepe the whole Law,</hi> doth not look at the Primitive inſtitution of it, but hath reſpect to that which the falſe Apoſtles intended, urging Circumciſion as a work of the Law, neceſſary to their juſtification and ſalvation; and thus taking it, the Apoſtle doth truly tell them, that if they were circumciſed in this manner, and to this end, they were bound to keepe the whole Law, becauſe by what reaſon Circumciſion was neceſſary, by the ſame reaſon all the reſt of the Law was neceſſary alſo; and if they were bound to obſerve Circumciſion, to be juſtified by it, then were they alſo bound to obſerve the whole Law, becauſe if wee be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by workes, wee muſt doe all the Law to obtaine juſtification by it. This is the Apoſtles intent, but this doth no more prove Circumciſion to be a ſeale of the covenant of workes, then our Baptiſme is. Concerning which, I may ſay as much as <hi>Paul</hi> doth of Circumciſion, if any ſhall eſteeme Baptiſme as a worke by which to be juſtified, I will then ſay to ſuch a one, that if he be baptized in this manner, and for this end, to be juſtified by it, as by a worke, that then he is bound to keepe the whole Law.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113533:39"/> ſay concerning the better Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.6. Where the compariſon is betwixt the Teſtament under the Meſſiah, and the Teſtament under <hi>Levi,</hi> as the verſes before doe make manifeſt: the Teſtament under the Meſſiah is called <hi>a better Teſtament then that under Levi;</hi> yet was that Teſtament under <hi>Levi,</hi> a Teſtament or Covenant of grace, and not of workes. This therefore I conceive, that thoſe <hi>better promiſes,</hi> are not ſo called in regard of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the promiſes, but of the manner of propounding them; Even as the ſacrifices of the new Teſtament, are ſaid to be better then the ſacrifices of the old, not in ſubſtance, but in the manner of exhibiting; (If I may ſo ſpeake) they had the ſame ſacrifices in ſubſtance, as wee have, even the Lambe ſlaine from the foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. But he was then ſlaine onely in types and figures, not really or perſonally. But now in the new Teſtament, there is a reall and perſonall offering up of Chriſt himſelfe, and not in the type onely, and therefore it is called <hi>a better ſacrifice.</hi> And ſo it is in the promiſes, the promiſe of eternall life was then made, but how? ſeldome plainly expreſſed, but ſhadowed over in the promiſe of their dwelling in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was to them a type of heaven; but now wee have the promiſe of eternall life plainly and nakedly ſet before us: ſo that wee may ſay as they ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>Now ſpeakeſt thou plainly, and ſpeakeſt no parables,</hi> now the Lord ſpeakes to us without putting ſuch vailes before our eyes, which held them that they did not ſee into the end of that which was ſpoken, ſo as now, in this ſenſe, our promiſes are better then theirs, becauſe more clearly and plainly revealed. In a word, the Covenant under the Meſſiah is compared with the Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Levi:</hi> the ſacrifices of the one, with the ſacrifices of the other; the promiſes of the one, with the promiſes of the other; Looke then, how the one is better, ſo are they all; as the ſacrifices of the one are better then the ſacrifices of the other, ſo is the Teſtament, and ſo are the promiſes; which betterneſſe, is not in the ſubſtance, but in the manner of revealing.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of it in the relative conſideration, as it had reſpect to that people, and to the covenant of grace before made with them in <hi>Abraham</hi> and of this conſideration of it, he ſpeakes from Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 3.17. to Chapter 4.21. and then from the beginning of ver. 21. of the fourth Chapter, to the end of the Chapter, there he begins to intreat of the Law, as ſimply conſidered in it ſelfe. And indeed, if wee ſo conſider it ſimply by it ſelfe, it doth containe nothing but a covenant of workes, and begets children to bondage, which ſhall have no inheritance with the children of promiſe, which lay hold of the new Covenant; but yet the former truth ſtill holds firme, and unſhaken, namely, that it was not a Covenant of workes, as it had reſpect to that people, that is, it was not given to them with intent that they ſhould looke to be juſtified, and to live thereby, but onely to lead them to Chriſt, and to reſtraine tranſgreſſion, as the Apoſtle fully ſhewes in the third Chapter. This two-fold conſideration of the Law here ſpoken of, is evident to any that doth with attention read thoſe two Chapters, and attends to the ſcope of them; for that which the Apoſtle ſpeakes concerning the Law, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> being under the Law, Chap. 4.1, 2, 3. &amp;c. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of thoſe that are under it, as under a Covenant of workes, but of thoſe that were children of God by grace, though yet under age, &amp;c. Againe, that which he ſpeakes of the Law in Chap. 4.29, 30. with the verſes before, from <hi>ver.</hi> 21. to the end,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113533:41"/> cannot be applyed otherwiſe then to the children of the Law and Covenant of workes, ſtrictly and properly ſo called. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this two-fold conſideration of the Law is grounded upon the Text it ſelfe. And the Apoſtle ariſeth from one of theſe unto the other; Firſt, ſpeaking of the Law as it had reference to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhewing for what end it was given unto them, which he handles Chapter 3.17. to Chap. 4.21. and then falls to an abſolute conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of it in it ſelfe, ſhewing the danger of being under the Law, being ſo conſidered ſimply as a covenant of workes, namely, that it caſts us out of the inheritance, which is given onely to the children of promiſe; the Covenant then which God made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Sinai,</hi> was a covenant of grace, God renewing with them the former covenant made before with them in <hi>Abraham,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all did then ſhew them the covenant of workes, what it was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to force them to cleave unto the former promiſe of grace.</p>
               <p>The ſumme is, that though the Law (which containes the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes) was delivered to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> by a Mediator, <hi>(Moſes)</hi> by reaſon of that reference it had in them to the covenant of grace, yet was it not ſo given by a Mediator un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom it was given as a meere covenant of workes, by which he ſhould live. And in this appeares the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one Covenant and the other, the covenant of workes is without a Mediator, there being no breach between God and man, when the covenant of workes was given. But the covenant of grace is by a Mediator, to make up the breach which ſin hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, ſo as now in this eſtate of ſin, there is no peace with God, no bleſſing from God, but it muſt be obtained by the Mediator between God and man, Jeſus Chriſt. Hence is that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13.16.18. where the Apoſtle ſhewes how both Jewes and Gentiles are made neere to God <hi>by Chriſt; Wee were aliens and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but now are made Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God, and have entrance and acceſſe to the Father</hi> by Chriſt. Neither is there any other bleſſing to be looked for, but as it comes to us through the hand of the Mediator; he it is that <hi>hath received gifts for men,</hi> Pſal. 68.18. and he <hi>gives gifts to men,</hi> Eph. 4.8. by him <hi>wee have remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> Eph. 1.7. by him <hi>wee receive the Spirit of life and grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. By him the Mediator, wee enter and are brought into covenant with God; by him we are kept in covenant
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113533:41"/> with him; by him wee receive all the bleſſings of the Covenant; and without a Mediator there is no peace, no bleſſing to be looked for. All the promiſes of the Covenant are made by him, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.) In him they are <hi>yea and Amen:</hi> though every promiſe doe not by name mention Chriſt, yet it hath reſpect unto Chriſt, and without Chriſt wee can receive nothing that comes in the nature of a bleſſing, or that comes from grace. Grace comes onely by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17.</p>
               <p>This ſerves to let us ſee the miſery of all ſuch as are under the <label type="milestone">

               <p>It may ſerve for direction, Doe we then deſire to be in covenant <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> with God, to be under grace, and to partake with the Saints in the bleſſings of this Covenant? Then truſt not to your ſelves, to your own righteouſneſſe, but goe to Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator of the Covenant; give up your ſelves unto him, put your ſelves into his hand, and goe hand in hand with him into the preſence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he may mediate for you, and plead your cauſe. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, Goe thou and ſpeake unto God for us;</hi> ſo let us ſay unto Chriſt, Lord Jeſus, Goe thou and plead with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113533:42"/> for us, if wee come neare unto God without thee, wee dye, the fire will conſume us, wee are deſtroyed. This is the way. All men hope well of themſelves, and truſt to their own righteouſneſſe, or elſe, they thinke that the promiſes of God are large, and that Chriſt is a Mediator for all men; and as the <hi>Jewes</hi> truſted in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Joh. 5. ſo doe all now truſt in Chriſt; And uſually none are more confident then thoſe, that never knew their need of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betwixt God and them. But as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had they not heard thoſe thundercrackes, ſeene the lightning, and tempeſt, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, had not theſe made them afraid, and ſhaken their hearts, they would never have gone ſo unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and beſought him to be a Mediator between God and them; ſo ſurely is it with us, wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to Chriſt to mediate for us, till by the Law wee ſee our ſelves to be dead condemned men. Here therefore begin, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the terrors of the Law, ſee and read thine own condemnation and curſe againſt thee by that Covenant; and then as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they were ſlung with the fiery Serpents, they looked up to the braſen Serpent, by it to be healed, and as they in their feare went unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo let us in our feare goe unto the Lord Jeſus, who is the onely Mediator between God and us.</p>
               <p>It may ſerve for incouragement unto ſuch as are ſmitten downe with the terrors of the Almightie, ſo as they dare not approach neare unto God, to offer up any ſervice, or ſacrifice unto him, but God appeares in their eyes as a conſuming fire, they had rather fly unto the holes of the rockes, and have mountaines to cover them, and hills to fall upon them, then to approach before the face of the dreadfull and juſt God: As <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.21. the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtood afar off from God, they durſt not draw near, becauſe they ſaw God as a conſuming fire, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.7. ſo it is with ſome fearfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, God is terrible unto them, they dare not come neare where the Lord is, to have any thing to doe with him: thus it was with <hi>Adam</hi> after he had ſinned, he runs into the thicket to hide himſelfe from the preſence of the Lord; and rather would he have had the trees fired about his eares, and himſelfe to have been turned to aſhes with them, then to have been brought forth before the face of God, to anſwer for his ſin which he had done. Thus alſo it was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himſelfe after his ſin of pride in numbering the people, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.30. But let ſuch remember what the Lord ſpake to the children
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:113533:42"/> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the like caſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.18.20. <hi>Feare not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> for God is come to prove you, <hi>that his feare may be in you,</hi> that you ſin not; feare not with a ſlaviſh and ſervile feare, to fly from his preſence; onely feare him with a reverend feare, feare to ſin againſt him: Let them not be afraid to come before God, but conſider though there is no acceſſe to the Lord, whiles they be under the Law, there being none there, to mediate for them; yet let them fly from that Covenant to a Covenant of grace, and here there is an Advocate, a Mediator ever ſtanding at the right hand of God, to plead for ſuch as come unto God by him; ſo that though we have been enemies and ſtrangers, yet coming for grace in the Mediator his name, there is hope wee may finde grace and acceptance by him; therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>Through him wee have acceſſe unto the Father,</hi> &amp;c. and Chap. 3.12. <hi>In him wee have boldneſſe and acceſſe with confidence.</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave all that come unto God by him.</hi> Be our caſe never ſo miſerable in our owne eyes, yet if wee come unto God by him, he is able to ſave us to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt; and if wee come unto him, <hi>he will not caſt us away,</hi> Joh. 6.37.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:113533:43"/> Chriſt, ſtanding betwixt God and us, keeps us together, that wee can never fall aſunder; he pleads with the Father to reconcile him to us, when he is angry with us, he pleads alſo with us, and when wee are going backe from God, he brings us to him againe, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing in us our repentings before him; he draws the heart againe before the throne of grace, powres upon us a ſpirit of grace and ſupplication, puts in our mouths words of confeſſion, and ſtirres up in us ſighes and groanes of ſpirit, intreating the Lord that though wee have gone backe from him, yet he would againe receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.2.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Differ. </seg>3</label> The third difference between the Covenant of workes, and of grace, is this; That in the covenant of workes Gods acceptation begins with the worke, and ſo goes on to the worker or perſon working; But in the covenant of grace, his acceptation begins with the perſon, and ſo goes on unto the worke; In the one God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the perſon for the workes ſake: In the other, God rewards the worke for the perſons ſake. Hereof it is that the life promiſed in the Covenant of workes,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.4.</note> is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a debt, as due unto the worke unto which it is promiſed. But that which is promiſed in the covenant of grace, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a gift, as being freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the perſon, without reſpect to any worke, or if to the work, yet for the perſons ſake. This word <hi>(gratis)</hi> freely, puts the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the covenant of workes and of grace. In the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of work, God juſtifies the doers of the Law, but not <hi>(gratis)</hi> freely; but in the covenant of grace God juſtifies freely, without reſpect to the worke, out of love to the perſon. This is noted in the ſpeech of <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning <hi>Abel;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>God had reſpect to Abel, and to his ſacrifice; Abel</hi> being a believer, and under grace, God had reſpect to his ſacrifice, but it was becauſe he firſt had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi> himſelfe. Hence alſo is that argument of theirs in <hi>Judges</hi> 13.23.<note place="margin">Judg. 13.23.</note> 
                  <hi>If</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Lord would ſlay us, he would not have accepted an offering at our hands.</hi> They reaſon from the acceptance of their ſervice, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of their perſon; becauſe the perſon is accepted firſt, and therefore if the offering be accepted, then the perſon much more.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:113533:43"/> But on the contrary, the Lord threatneth, that when he tooke no pleaſure in their perſons,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.10.</note> then their offerings ſhould not be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ſo when <hi>Elijah</hi> and the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> offered the ſame kinde of ſacrifice, God accepted the ſacrifice of <hi>Elijah,</hi> but not of the other, becauſe his perſon was accepted, but theirs were not. In 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.52.<note place="margin">1 King 8.52.</note> God is ſaid to have his eyes open to heare the prayers of his people; it is not the eye which heares, but the eare; yet God is ſaid to have his eyes open to heare our prayers, becauſe there is ſomething firſt in Gods eye, which makes his eare to liſten unto our cry: Firſt he looks favourably upon our perſons, and hath a gracious reſpect unto our ſelves, and then he bowes his eare to the prayer which we make before him. According to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15.<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.15.</note> 
                  <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his eare is open to their prayers.</hi> Thus it is in the Covenant of grace, Gods acceptance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth firſt with the perſon. And hence it is that when God hath caſt favour upon the perſon, then he accepts weake ſervices from them. A cup of cold water is better accepted from ſuch an one,<note place="margin">Mat. to laſt. Micah 6.6, 7.</note> then a thouſand rivers of oyle from another hand; yea though there be imperfections and weakneſſes in the thing done, yet God paſſeth by the weakneſſes for the favour he beares unto the perſon. As wee may ſee in <hi>Jacob,</hi> he ſeekes the bleſſing, but mixeth ſo much imperfection and ſin in it, that if God had not accepted his perſon, he might have brought a curſe upon himſelfe in ſtead of a bleſſing; but God had ſaid, <hi>Jacob have I loved,</hi> and therefore though he liked not his diſſembling, yet he paſſed by his infirmitie, and <hi>Jacob</hi> got the bleſſing. And ſo <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 11. ult.</note> though the thing which he had done diſpleaſed the Lord, yet God tooke not his mercy from him, as he tooke it from <hi>Saul;</hi> for <hi>Saul</hi> was under a covenant of workes, and <hi>David</hi> under a covenant of grace. Herein the Lord would ſhew, that it was the perſon, not the worke which he had reſpect unto. But <hi>Adam</hi> being under a covenant of workes, he finds acceptance with God no longer then his worke is found perfect before him. All his perſonall indowments, excellent gifts, and the Image of God which was ſtamped upon him, by which he was but little inferiour to the Angels, all theſe could procure him no favour or acceptance any longer then his worke was right; becauſe he was under the Covenant of workes, his perſon is accepted according to his worke.</p>

Be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in comforted, that the weakeſt and pooreſt ſervices that you put up to God in Chriſt, are accepted of him. Theſe are many times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by reaſon of their weake performances; Oh! there is ſo much deadneſſe, coldneſſe, dulneſſe, ſo many by-thoughts, ſuch hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie in their beſt actions, that they cannot thinke that ever ſuch ſorry ſervices, ſuch lame and ſick ſacrifices ſhould be accepted of God. But tell me, you that thus complaine; To what do you look, that you may finde acceptance with God? To your workes, or to the riches of grace revealed in the covenant of grace, accepting your perſon through Chriſt? Doe you looke that your worke ſhould be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:113533:44"/> accepted for its own ſake, or through grace in Chriſt, your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being firſt accepted in him? If you looke to your workes, God regards neither you nor them; but if you fly to the aboundance of grace, looking for your acceptance there, then feare not, thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt endeavours are accepted before God, and doe find favour in his fight. Our comfort lyes not in the excellency of our duties, but in our free acceptance in Chriſt. Thinke thus, thy workes being done never ſo weakly, are not worſe then thou thy ſelfe waſt, when firſt thou wenteſt to the throne of grace, begging to be received through grace. If then God did in mercy accept thee when thou waſt ſo vile, doubt not, but out of the ſame grace and mercy he will accept thy worke alſo; his promiſe being that he will ſpare ſuch, as a man ſpareth his ſonne that ſerveth him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17.<note place="margin">Mal. 3.17.</note> Great cauſe haſt thou to be humbled and diſpleaſed with thy ſelfe, that thou canſt performe no better ſervice to thy God, that thou art ſo dead and liveleſſe in the things of thy God, who hath ſo graciouſly looked upon thee. But no cauſe therefore to thinke that thy ſervice is not accepted; becauſe Gods acceptance begins in the perſon, not in the worke, accepting the worke for the perſons ſake. And therefore if God have accepted thy perſon, he will accept thy worke alſo.</p>
               <p>The fourth difference is this; In the Covenant of workes, a man <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Differ. </seg>4</label> is left to himſelfe, to ſtand by his own ſtrength; But in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, God undertakes with us, to keep us through faith. The reaſon of this difference is, becauſe when God comes to make a Covenant of workes with <hi>Adam,</hi> he finds him furniſhed with a ſufficiency of power which was put into him in his creation. But when he comes to make with us a Covenant of grace in this eſtate of ſin, he finds us of no ſtrength: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.6.</note> impotent, feeble, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a ſpirit of infirmitie, made up of weakneſſes, having no power; and therefore <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.29. the Lord promiſeth unto ſuch that <hi>he will give ſtrength unto them, and increaſe power.</hi> The Lord knowes the infirmitie of our fleſh, how impoſſible it is for us to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill any part of the righteouſneſſe which the Law requires, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> He knowes alſo what powers we have againſt us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tells us, that we are kept not by our own power, but by his power through faith unto ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5.</note> And hence is that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28.<note place="margin">Joh. 10.28.</note> Chriſt tells us, that none ſhall plucke us out of his hand. And this is the reaſon, that though <hi>Adam</hi> fell from his firſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:113533:45"/> eſtate, and loſt the life promiſed in that Covenant made with him, yet we fall not; he had more ſtrength of grace then wee, and wee have more corruption then he, (for he was then pure without ſin) yet being left to his own liberty, he willingly forſooke the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, and fell into a ſtate of perdition. But wee being weaker then he, (yet being once taken into the Covenant of grace) though we have the ſame powers of darkneſſe againſt us as he had, yet wee fall not ſo as to ſin unto perdition, as he did; becauſe wee are ſupported by the power of God. <hi>Adams</hi> life was put into his own hand, ours is put into the hand of Chriſt, wee are committed to his care and truſt; The Father hath given us unto the Sonne, the Sonne hath taken us, at the hand of the Father, and hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with the Father for us, to preſent us before him.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> See hence the ground of that which ſometimes ſeems marvellous in our eyes; we ſee men of different abilities, ſome ſimple, weak and deſpiſed, others indued with eminent gifts, and excellent parts; yet thoſe that ſo excell, many times fade, and fall away; their graces wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their light is extinct, and they go out like the ſmoke of a candle, with an ill ſavour; whereas the weak and ſimple ones are upholden, and go from ſtrength to ſtrength, and increaſe with the increaſings of God. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe the one ſort viewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own excellencies in the glaſſe of their own conceit, they truſt in themſelves, and in their own ſtrength, and do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their ſouls to God to be kept by him, and ſo are left unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And then at length, meeting with ſome temptation, which is ſtronger then they, their confidence and their ſtrength fails them, and ſo they fall, and being left unto themſelves, they are never able to riſe any more; whereas the other being ſenſible of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, and caſting themſelves on the power of God to be kept thereby, they are hereby preſerved and upholden againſt all the powers of darkneſſe which are againſt them; ſo that either they fall not, or if they do fall, yet they riſe again. And thus it comes to paſſe, that theſe that are weak in themſelves, they are ſtrong through
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:113533:45"/> Chriſt: as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9.</note> And thoſe that are ſtrong in themſelves, are indeed weake in the power of God, having no help nor aſſiſtance from him, and ſo are quite overthrown.</p>
               <p>This may ſtay the mindes of thoſe that are weak, they think they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> ſhall never hold out.

If a friend relying upon thy truſt and faithfulneſſe ſhould bring a Jewell to thee, and intreat thee to keep it carefully, thou wouldeſt be aſhamed to be careleſſe of it.

               <p>In the covenant of works, Gods higheſt end is the glorifying of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Differ. </seg>5</label> his juſtice; In the Covenant of grace, it is to glorifie his Grace: In the Covenant of Works, God reveales himſelf a juſt God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding good, and puniſhing evill, condemning ſin; but in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, he ſhews himſelf a God gracious and merciful, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32.<note place="margin">Jer. 31.31, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>I will be mercifull to your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> &amp;c. The Covenant of Works forgiveth no ſin, there is nothing but ſtrict juſtice in that Covenant. In this Covenant, God looks not at any mans repentance and turning from ſin, but only conſiders, whether he hath ſinned: As in Courts of Juſtice, where there are tried matters of life and death, there is no regard had, whether the party be penitent, or no, but whether the fact be committed, and if found guilty, he is led to execution; ſo in Gods Court of Juſtice, which he keeps according to the tenor of the Covenant of Works, Juſtice acts and doth all. Juſtice indictes, Juſtice examines, Juſtice pronounceth ſentence, Juſtice executes the puniſhment; and ſo whoſoever hath ſinned, receives according to the evil that he hath done. And hence it is, that when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not, whether he repented him of the evill that he had done;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:113533:46"/> but, what haſt thou done? Haſt thou eaten of the tree, whereof I ſaid unto thee, thou ſhalt not eat? And the Lord finding that he had offended, pronounces curſes and death. But in the Covenant of Grace it is otherwiſe. There God looks at the repentance of his people, and accepts of humiliation, and faith in Chriſt. Hence is the counſell of the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.<note place="margin">Acts 2.37.</note> 
                  <hi>Repent, and be baptized,</hi> &amp;c. When they ſaw the horrible ſin which they had done, in killing the Lord of life, they being the children of the Covenant, he tels them, that yet there was mercy for them, they might obtain forgiveneſſe of ſins. Hence alſo, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.10.<note place="margin">Jonah 3.10.</note> when God ſaw their repentance, and that they turned from their evill wayes, he alſo turned from the evill which he ſaid he would do to them, and did it not. The voyce of the Covenant of Works, is like the firſt ſpeech of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Thou art a childe of death;</hi> the voyce of the Covenant of Grace, is like his after ſpeech, when he ſaw <hi>Davids</hi> humiliation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin.</hi> In the Covenant of Works, God ſpeaks, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die:</hi> In the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, he ſpeaks, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note> 
                  <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of a ſinner.</hi> They are both expreſſed in one place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6.<note place="margin">Exod. 34.6.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord gracious and mercifull, ſlow to anger,</hi> yet not acquitting the wicked, but viſiting iniquitie, &amp;c. In one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, God condemnes both ſin and ſinner; in the other, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes the ſin, but ſpares, and gives life to the ſinner, to glorifie his grace thereby. In the Covenant of workes, he aymes to make his power and juſtice knowne; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 2.5.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.22. &amp; cap. 2.5.</note> But in the other, to glorifie grace; as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.9. &amp; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. The reaſon of this difference is, becauſe God will be glorified in all his attributes; as he is glorious in all, ſo he will have the glory of all to be ſeene. He will have his power and wiſdome knowne in the creation of the world, his goodneſſe knowne in the continuance and preſervation and ordering of it, his faithfulneſſe in keeping covenant with us, according to the covenant made, his juſtice in a covenant of works, his grace in a covenant of grace which he makes with us in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

Let one fulfill the Law, and he ſhall live thereby; Let another fulfill it, and he alſo ſhall have the ſame life.

Here is <hi>our owne,</hi> and <hi>Gods owne;</hi> our owne, is that which we looke for according to our agreement which wee have made with God, for the worke done. As thoſe hyred into the Vineyard, they agreed with the Maſter of the Vineyard for ſo much; and that which they ſo agreed for, for their worke, that was their owne, due by Juſtice; But that which was not by agreement, nor for worke, but comes by grace, that is Gods owne, with which he may doe even as he will: our owne is that which is due from Gods juſtice, Gods owne is the gift of his free grace. To every one God will ſay, take thine owne. And where there is no difference in worke, Juſtice will make no difference in wages. And if any begin to complaine that others are better dealt with then they, the Lord anſwers to ſuch, I will doe with <hi>mine owne</hi> as I will; Grace is mine owne, and I owe it to none, I will ſhew it where I will; It is grace which makes the difference, herein may God deale diverſly, giving more to one, leſſe to another, as pleaſeth him.

But ſuch muſt know that ſo long as the ſinnes that are in us be repented of, and mourned for, it is not one nor many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which can make voyd the Covenant of grace, which wee are entred into, or hinder us of the bleſſing that comes thereby. Wee muſt remember, that <hi>we are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> wee muſt not be too ſevere againſt our ſelves, like <hi>Novatians</hi> denying pardon to ſecond falls; In ſo doing we ſet ſuch limits to the grace of God, as he himſelfe hath not ſet. God hath not ſaid, He will pardon once and no more, or that he will pardon ſinnes before grace received, but not thoſe committed after, God never ſo ſtinted his grace, but his gift of grace is againſt many offences unto juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of life. In denying therefore of pardon to our ſelves for ſins iterated, and for our often infirmities, (ſo long as there is a ſpirit of repentance working in us, and we are humbled for them before God) we doe not onely wrong our ſelves, and deprive our ſoules of the peace we might enjoy, but we do wrong to the grace of God, as if that grace were not ſufficient for us, as if that God could not, or would not, renew his gracious pardon to us, as wee renew our repentance towards him. Let ſuch conſider what the Lord hath commanded us to doe, we muſt not onely forgive ſeven times, but ſeventy times ſeven times, if our brother turne againe and ſay, <hi>it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth me.</hi> And can wee thinke that God lookes for more mercy from us towards our brethren, then he will ſhew towards his owne children? He hath bidden us daily to pray for the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, as knowing that we are ſubject to daily infirmities, and doe ſtand in need of daily mercy and forgiveneſſe. And therefore to limit Gods grace, as we are apt to doe, is in effect to turne the Covenant of grace into a Covenant of workes, as if there were no more grace under the one, then under the other. Know therefore that whiles there is in us an holy watchfulneſſe, againſt the ſin that dwells within us, whiles it is our deſire and care to pleaſe the Lord, whiles we feele in our ſelves the ſpirit of grace, cauſing us to mourne over him whom we have pierced by our ſinnes, though we be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:113533:50"/> again and again through the infirmity of the fleſh that is in us, yet know, that it is not one, nor many offences that can deprive us of the bleſſing of this covenant of grace in which God hath promiſed to multiply forgiveneſſes according to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his great mercies. Yet let no man abuſe this doctrine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to carnall liberty: this is childrens bread, impure dogges, and carnall livers, that make no conſcience of ſinning, have nothing to doe with this conſolation; it is onely to ſupport the weak, to comfort the feeble minded, not to encourage the wicked and impenitent in their ſin. Let ſuch know, that though God abound in mercy, and do multiply forgiveneſſes unto ſuch as are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their ſins; yet he will multiply plagues alſo upon impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent wretches that goe on in their evill way. To ſuch neither many, nor any one of all their ſins ſhall be forgiven, but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, they ſhall make an account to God for every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, God will repay them all their wickedneſſes, not one ſhall be forgotten or forgiven. He is indeed abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, reſerving mercy for his people: and ſo he is alſo abundant in wrath againſt rebellious ſinners, and will abundantly reward the proud doer.</p>

This dubious anxiety, doth the Doctrine and Covenant of workes leave a man in; but the Covenant of grace takes away all theſe ſcruples; It ſaith not, <hi>Who ſhall goe up into heaven, &amp;c.</hi> It tells us, that Chriſt is aſcended to prepare a place for us; nor ſaith it, <hi>Who ſhall deſcend, &amp;c.</hi> It teacheth us to believe, that Chriſt is deſcended for to deliver us; So that this doctrine of grace frees the minde of thoſe ſcruples and perplexities, which the doctrine of workes leaves a man intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in. He that reſts on workes, is like a wave of the Sea, toſſed and tumbled up and down, and finds no reſt; he that reſts on grace is like one built upon a rock, and therefore cannot be ſhaken. The reaſon of this difference is, Becauſe the Law which containes the ſumme of the Covenant of workes, doth diſcover the perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, the puritie of his nature, his hatred againſt ſinne, his ſtrict juſtice and judgement, ſo as the ſoule that is but in the leaſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113533:53"/> meaſure privie to his own impurity and ſinfulneſſe, can never grow up to any confidence before God, by any thing which he hath done. When we have done the beſt we can reach unto, yet the heart will ſtill be doubtfull, whether that which we have done, be fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the holineſſe which the holy God requires and lookes for. And thus it was with the young man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Mark. 10.</note> that was ſo perfect in his owne eyes, who thought he had kept all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Law mentioned to him, yet he comes as one unſatisfied in his own minde, and doubtfull, whether he had done enough to bring him unto life. And therefore comes to Chriſt, to know what more he ſhould doe beſide what he had done alreadie. The Papiſts, who build upon their workes, teach a doctrine of doubting; No man (ſay they) can come to be aſſured and ſetled in an undoubted perſwaſion of his own ſalvation; and well may they teach ſuch a doctrine, when they build upon ſuch a ſandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own workes. Let them eſtabliſh their owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with all the ſtrength they can, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.3.</note> yet as long as they reſt here, and doe not ſubmit to the righteouſneſſe which is offered by grace, the iſſue will be anxiety of mind, fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, conſcience will be perplexed, it will never finde reſt nor peace: but let a man renounce his own righteouſneſſe, and fly to the Covenant of grace, and caſt himſelfe wholly upon grace; here is a ſure rock for the anchor of our faith to reſt upon.</p>
               <p>Let us then hereby ſee the way of peace, to quietneſſe of heart, <label type="milestone">

But if wee reſt on the foundation of grace, that is a rock that is higher then our ſelves, there is ſafety, all the ſurges and waves of greateſt troubles, can never get above the top of this rock; ſtand here, and we are ſafe for ever.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113533:54"/> that build upon their workes; the cauſe of their feare is, not becauſe there is not a ſufficient foundation to beare them up, but becauſe their adhaerence and dependence is feeble and weak. They are weak in faith, they are fleſh and ſpirit, there is in them a ſpirit of faith, which cleaves to grace, and there is alſo a ſpirit of unbeliefe, which is leaning to their owne workes, and this cauſeth their doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But it is otherwiſe with thoſe that doe wholly reſt upon their workes. Let a man build himſelfe upon theſe never ſo reſolutely, let him eſtabliſh his own righteouſneſſe with all the ſtrength he can, yet this will never give him aſſurance, not becauſe he doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haere firmly to his foundation, but becauſe his foundation is nought and ſhakes under him. Suppoſe two men, both in feare of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by water; one ſtands on a firme rock, the other on a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; he that ſtands on the quick-ſand, ſtands there reſolutely, he that is on the rock is doubtfull and weake in his reſolution; So it is in this caſe. In the one of theſe, the foundation is firme, but adhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is weake; In the other adhaerence is ſtrong, but his foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is unſound.

               <p>But Chriſt who was the Miniſter of the covenant of grace, <label type="milestone">

               <p n="2">2. The different manner of the diſpenſation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt; the Fathers before Chriſt were under the ſame covenant of grace as we be; not they under one covenant, and we under another, and this we will ſhew in two things: Firſt, that they had the ſame promiſe and hope of life and ſalvation as wee have. Secondly, they had it upon the ſame ground, and in the ſame way, <hi>ſcil.</hi> by faith in the free grace of God by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They had the ſame promiſe and hope of eternall ſalvation. This is neceſſary to bee conſidered, becauſe of the Anabaptiſts, which teach, that they lived and died without hope of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, onely fed with temporall promiſes, and fatted like ſwine with earthly bleſſings, but without hope of a better life. But the contrary is evident by the promiſes that were made to them, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>I will be your God, and yee ſhall be my people;</hi> but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that God is not the God of the dead, but of the living, Matth.</hi> 22.32.<note place="margin">Mat. 22.31.</note> But it is more plain, <hi>Deut.</hi> 38.29. <hi>Happy art thou, O Iſrael, ſaved by the Lord.</hi> If they had had onely temporall promiſes, they might have been called a miſerable people, according to that of <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.19.</note> 
                  <hi>If in this life onely we had hope, we were of all men the moſt miſerable,</hi> they could not have been called <hi>an happy people. Iſai.</hi> 33.22.<note place="margin">Iſai. 33.22.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord is our King, and he will ſave us.</hi> They did therefore look for, and expect life and ſalvation. And Chriſt ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo of the reſt of the Fathers before Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>That many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in the Kingdome of God.</hi> Therefore the old Patriarchs are in heaven,<note place="margin">Mat. 1.8.1</note> and therefore it is an helliſh and diabolicall doctrine, that they were fed onely with temporall promiſes. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10. it is plain, they had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hope of an earthly inheritance in <hi>Canaan,</hi> but the hope of an heavenly inheritance in the Kingdome of God. And in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, what more abſurd then to imagine, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be called <hi>the Father of the Faithfull,</hi> and we to be called <hi>his children,</hi> and yet we to have an eternall inheritance in heaven, and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the Father of us all, to have only a temporal here upon earth.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:113533:59"/> Againe, the Saints profeſſed themſelves pilgrims and ſtrangers upon the earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. and <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39.12.<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.12.</note> Which ſhewes that they had hopes of a better inheritance then that of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Againe, they had the ſame Spirit as we have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12.<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.12.</note>

               <p n="2">2. As they had the ſame promiſe and hope of life, ſo they had it upon the ſame ground as we have, even by faith in the free grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus. They had the ſame Goſpel of grace that wee have. Hence is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2.<note place="margin">Rom 1.2.</note> the Goſpel was promiſed before by the Prophets to the Fathers.

So alſo in the Songs of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi> Luk. 1.54.72.<note place="margin">Luk. 1.54.72.</note> The revealing and fulfilling of our redemption by Chriſt is made to be the accompliſhment of the promiſes made unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

Hence <hi>Jude</hi> 3. it is called <hi>the common ſalvation,</hi> common to all believers, both before and after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This may teach us to abhorre that ſwiniſh opinion of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> who make the Fathers before Chriſt, to have lived onely under a temporall Covenant, promiſing to them temporall things, feeding their bellies, and fatting them up with outward bleſſings; but they had no hope of eternall life; Whereas Chriſt (who is the truth) tells us, that they are in the kingdome of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.11.<note place="margin">Mat. 8.11.</note>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Let us looke unto the old Covenant made with the Fathers, and hold to that doctrine of life, which was of old given unto the Saints; Let us ſtand to that, and contend for it, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. There is a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Land, that are altogether looking after new light, and new truths, and the old truths delivered to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> are nothing with them. But let us take heed, leſt while we gape after new light, and new truths, we drinke not in old poyſoned er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and be fed with windy fancies in ſtead of bread. <hi>Aske for the old way,</hi> Jer. 6.16.<note place="margin">Jer. 6.16.</note> The old way is the good way, wherein you muſt finde reſt to your ſoules; Men have itching eares, itching mindes, and itching tongues alſo, itching to be fed with, and to be venting novelties. It hath been the blemiſh of our Engliſh Nation, that they have been alwayes new-fangled, running after new faſhions, taking up the faſhions of every Nation. The poverty of our eſtates will not here permit us to follow new faſhions, but yet ſtill the vanitie of our mindes is working and doating upon our new opinions, whereby men are led into pathes, that were not troden by the Fathers of old. God charges the falſe Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.15.<note place="margin">Jer. 18.15.</note> that they led his people from the ancient wayes. Whiles every one is forward to vent his own imagination, and hath libertie ſo to doe, every one ſaying, I have ſeene, I have ſeene, (when indeed they have ſeene nothing but the vanitie and lying imagination of their own heart) they fill the world with idle fancies, which breed queſtions, rather then godly edifying. Aske therefore for the way which <hi>Abraham, David, Moſes, Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> with the reſt of the Prophets walked in, and departed not therefrom. Though we have cauſe to praiſe the Lord for the aboundant manifeſtation of the Doctrine of Grace in theſe dayes, more then before Chriſts coming in the fleſh, yet the Doctrine is the ſame; As the light of the Sun which ſhines at noone-time, or mid-day, is the ſame light which ſhined in the morning, onely more cleare and bright then before; ſo the Doctrine of Grace,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:113533:60"/> though more clearly manifeſted then formerly, when hid under types and ſhadowes, yet the truth is the ſame. Wee hope to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by grace, as they did, and they had the ſame Doctrine of Grace as we have, therefore ſeeke we after the old way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But though the ſubſtance of the Covenant was the ſame then and now, yet there is a difference in regard of the manner of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and revealing, it being diverſly propounded, according to the ſeverall times, ages, ſtates, and conditions of the Church, delivered one way before the coming of Chriſt, and another way afterward. And therefore in regard of the old way, and manner of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, it's called <hi>the old Covenant,</hi> and in regard of the new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſpenſing, it's called <hi>the new Covenant.</hi> The ſame Covenant therefore is called both new and old, as is evident, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8.13.<note place="margin">Heb. 8.8, 13.</note> But leſt any ſhould thinke, that the old Covenant there ſpoken of, was properly and ſtrictly the Covenant of workes, ſee what is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Pag.</hi> 59, 60. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, The Covenant, in the former diſpenſation of it, was more burthenſome, and heavie to be borne, and is now made to us more eaſie: which appeares by thoſe places of Scripture-ſpeeches, which the Holy-Ghoſt uſeth of the Ordinances of the old Teſtament. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10.<note place="margin">Acts 15.10.</note> They were a yoke which neither we nor our Fathers could beare; and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.20.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.20.</note> If (ſaith the Apoſtle) you be freed from theſe worldly Ordinances, why are you <hi>burthened</hi> with tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with it. Conſider the burthen that lay upon them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The burthen of their coſtly Sacrifices, that if any had but touched an uncleane thing, he muſt come, and offer ſacrifice, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a bullock, ſometime a lambe; If we were for every offence to offer ſuch ſacrifices, we ſhould count it an heavie burthen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They had long and tedious journeys to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the Land lay more in length then breadth, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtood almoſt at one end of it, and thither thrice a yeare all the males were to goe and appeare before God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They were reſtrained from many liberties which wee now enjoy, we are allowed many creatures for meat, which they might not eat, as the Hare, ſwine, &amp;c. Difference of meats is now taken away.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They were tyed to the obſervation of many dayes, the new Moones, and many Ceremoniall Sabbaths, to which they were bound, and not at libertie, as we are. Now whether wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect one of theſe, or all together, it was a burthenſome thing to them. But now the yoke is made more eaſie, therefore Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Jewiſh Church to a childe that in his nonage is under tutors and governours, till the time appointed by the Father. But the Church now is like a man growne up, that hath his patrimony in his own hand, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2.<note place="margin">Gal. 4.1, 2.</note> Though we be bound to the duties of the Morall Law as well as they, yet a great yoke is taken off from us.</p>

                  </label> Seeing we have ſo much libertie in the dayes of the Goſpel, and are eaſed of the burthen that lay upon them, it muſt teach us with the more freedome and willingneſſe to offer up thoſe ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices unto God which he calls for at our hands. He hath taken off from our ſhoulders the heavie yoke which lay upon them. Let us not therefore be as the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of whom the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.3.4.<note place="margin">Hoſea 11.3.4.</note> that though he had taken off the yoke, and laid meat before them, yet they were like an unruly beaſt that kicketh with the heele. If now when the Lord hath taken off the yoke of the Ceremoniall Law, and hath given us the Covenant of his grace without thoſe burthens that lay upon them, if yet we deale unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, and count thoſe ſpirituall ſervices which he requires from the inward man to be a burthen unto us, how may the Lord
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:113533:61"/> complaine of us much more? Let us therefore give unto the Lord voluntary and ſpirituall ſacrifices; the leſſer that our burthen is, the greater is the ſin, if we ſerve not the Lord with a chearfull heart in the ſervices he requires from us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Covenant was then revealed more darkly and obſcurely, but now the diſpenſation of it, is more cleare and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: the light now is marvellous, it is as the Sun ſhining at noone-day. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26.<note place="margin">Rom. 16.25, 26.</note> the Goſpel is called the revelation of the miniſtery which was kept ſecret ſince the foundation of the world, but it is now made manifeſt, &amp;c. Though it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed before, yet it was but darkly, but now it is revealed more clearly ſince the coming of our Saviour Chriſt; ſo alſo <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.4, 5.</note> and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.26.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.26.</note> Conſider the truth of this in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider the promiſe of eternall life, it was darkly cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over, not clearly promiſed to them: The promiſe of eternall life is very rarely in expreſſe termes mentioned in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I know but one place (which is in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2.<note place="margin">Dan. 12.2.</note>) where plaine mention is made of life eternall. It was ſhadowed out to them in the promiſe of inhabiting in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of eternall life; ſo the threatning of eternall death, was typed out by the threatning of excluſion out of the Lords Land. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9.3.<note place="margin">Hoſea 9.3.</note> When they ſhould be driven into captivity, it was a type of their ſending into hell, if they did not returne to walke with him in his Covenant. And hence are thoſe promiſes, <hi>They ſhall inherite the land, and dwell in the earth,</hi> Pſal. 37.11.<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.11.</note> Not as if that were all they were to looke for, but becauſe it was the type of another and better inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in heaven. This was the cauſe that made <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49.29.<note place="margin">Gen. 49.29.</note> give that charge to his ſonnes, that they ſhould not bury him in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but carry him into the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 50.24, 25. tooke an oath of his brethren, that they ſhould carry his bones with them; And why was this done, but becauſe they looked at that Land as more then an earthly poſſeſſion, taking it as a type of heaven, and by giving that charge, they teſtified their faith in the promiſe of God concerning the poſſeſſion of life eternall? Therefore alſo it was that <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he indured many troubles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries in the land of promiſe, and had time to have returned into his own Country, yet he would not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.15.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.15.</note> becauſe he looked at that, as a land of promiſe, and a type of the reſt that remained
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:113533:62"/> for him in the kingdome of God. Thus was the promiſe of eternall life obſcurely propounded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the revealing of Chriſt, either the perſon of Chriſt, or his offices, and wee ſhall ſee that they were darkly propounded unto them in reſpect of what they are to us. Chriſt was but ſhadowed out to them in types, and figures, and dark pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies. Concerning, his perſon it was revealed unto them that he ſhould be God, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.6.<note place="margin">Iſai. 9.6.</note> where he is called <hi>the mighty God;</hi> and alſo that he ſhould be man, and therefore ſaid to be borne, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. But how he ſhould be both God and man in one perſon, was very darkly revealed. Which made the <hi>Jewes</hi> that they could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that queſtion, how Chriſt ſhould be both Lord and ſonne to <hi>David.</hi> So for his offices; his Mediatorſhip was typed out by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his being between God and the people; his Prieſthood typed out by <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> among the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and his ſacrifice by their ſacrifices: his Propheticall office ſhadowed to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who revealed the minde of God to the people. Therefore ſaith <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 18.18.<note place="margin">Deut. 18.18.</note> 
                  <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you like unto me;</hi> which is applyed unto Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22.<note place="margin">Acts 3.22.</note> His Kingly office typed out in the kingdome of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Luk. 1.31.<note place="margin">Luk. 1.31.32.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſhall give him the kingdome of his Father David.</hi> But how darke theſe things were unto them, you may perceive by the ſpeeches of the Diſciples unto Chriſt, who knew not how he ſhould execute thoſe offices, they knew not that he ſhould dye, they dreamt of an earthly kingdome; they ſaw Chriſt under a vaile, but wee ſee him with open face, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The benefits that come by Chriſt were not ſo clearly made knowne to them as they are to us. Juſtification was ſignified by the ſprinkling of the bloud of the ſacrifice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.7, 8.<note place="margin">Exod. 24, 7, 8.</note> So ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification was typed out by the water of purification; The benefits which are ſo clearly revealed unto us, that Chriſt is our wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption, were but darkly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto them. So that the light now is become like the light at noone day, the light that they had was but like the dawning of the day, or the light of the ſtarres. Hence is that of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16, 17. <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee, and your eares, for they heare, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </label> Becauſe the work of our redemption was not then tranſacted and accompliſhed, the things were not then paſſed as now they be; and therefore as the light of the Sun is leſſe before its riſing, then afterward; ſo Chriſt before his riſing in the world, was not ſo fully knowne as ſince.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church was then in its minority and infancy, but now it is of full age, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2.<note place="margin">Galat. 4.1, 2.</note> Therefore as a Father gives ſome hints of his purpoſe and will, to his childe when he is under age, but makes knowne all his minde to him when he is growne up; ſo dealt the Lord with his Church then, as with children, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was meet that this glory ſhould be reſerved to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he being the great Prophet of the Church, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale more to the world then ever was knowne before. It was not meet that all ſhould be revealed before his coming, but that he ſhould have the glory of revealing thoſe deepe things which were hid with God, making them knowne to his Church and people. And therefore they were more darkly revealed before. Onely this obſerve, that the further the times were from Chriſts coming, the leſſe light they had, and the nearer to Chriſt, the more light ſprung up. The promiſe to <hi>Eve</hi> was more darke, more cleare to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſtill more cleare to <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. And the reaſon of this is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe Chriſt is the light of the world; Now as the Sunne the further it is from riſing, the leſſe light it gives, and the nearer to riſing, the more, ſo did Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The more light was diſcovered neare the coming of Chriſt, to ſtirre up the mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, Before the Law was given, there was leſſe ſenſe of ſin, and therefore the leſſe revelation of Chriſt: But as the ſenſe of ſin increaſed by the revelation of the Law, ſo there was more cleare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Chriſt to them; Though at the beſt, it was but darke in compariſon of what it is now in the dayes of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach us with thankfulneſſe to accept and prize theſe dayes of the Sonne of man, <label type="milestone">

                  </gap>ath ſo clearly revealed the Covenant of his Grace to us, that many Kings and Princes have deſired to ſee the things that wee ſee, &amp;c. Nay, how many in other Nations doe deſire to ſee the things that we ſee, and yet cannot ſee
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:113533:63"/> them? <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſt, but it was afarre off. The Iſraelites ſaw him, but he was then vailed. But now wee ſee him with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen face. How may wee ſtand and admire this grace, and ſay with the Diſciples,<note place="margin">John 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, why is it that thou wilt reveale thy ſelfe to us and not to the world?</hi> Count it not a ſmall mercy, that wee have Chriſt revealed ſo clearly now more then formerly. It is one of the great promiſes of God unto his Church, as we may ſee, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.9.<note place="margin">Iſai. 11.9.</note> 
                  <hi>That the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of God.</hi> And <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.34. <hi>That all ſhall know the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the dayes fore-ſpoken of, wherein wee doe in a degree and meaſure <hi>ſee eye to eye,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 52.8.</note> though ſomething more may be added in the converſion of the Jewes. As God therefore promiſeth it as a bleſſing, ſo count it a bleſſing. Chriſt taketh the vaile from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, and ſaith, <hi>Behold me, behold me, O yee ſonnes of men,</hi> Iſai. 65.<note place="margin">Iſai. 65.</note> Therefore,</p>
               <p>Firſt, grow up in the knowledge of the covenant, and of the bleſſings of it. We ſhould not now bee ignorant of what God hath promiſed on his part, nor what he requires on our part. If we have any intimation given us of a Legacy in ſome rich mans will, O how carefull are we to enquire into it! How much more ſhould we labour to know this Teſtament?</p>
               <p>Secondly, labour alſo to grow ſetled in the doctrine which the covenant teacheth us, not being carried away with every new fangled conceit, but grounded in the truth which you have received. Be children in malice, but in knowledge and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be men of ripe age, able to diſcerne between things that differ, and to try all things holding faſt that which is good. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we doe thus,</p>
               <p>Firſt, we loſe the benefit of the dayes of light in which we live, if we be ſtill ignorant of the covenant, and of the benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be received, and live not by faith in them, as good we had never heard them, we take Gods grace in vain: In vain ſhould the Sunne riſe and give light, if wee ſhut our eyes, and will not ſee it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we be ſtill ignorant of the doctrine of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and unſetled, it argues a ſinfull neglect, and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the grace of God, and of the light we enjoy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as men open their windowes when the day appeareth,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:113533:63"/> though they had drawn their curtains before, ſo let us open our eyes to diſcerne the doctrine of the grace of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if any be now ignorant and ungrounded in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of grace, it is a token of a dangerous eſtate: therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>If our Goſpel be now hid, it is bid to them that are loſt, in whom the God of this world, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo for ungrounded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſee what the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>That they that are unſtable and pervert the Scriptures, doe it to their own deſtruction.</hi> Seeing the doctrine of grace is ſo clearly manifeſted, let us labour to know it, and to be ſtabliſhed therein, that ſo we may turn nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the right hand nor to the left.</p>
               <p>Seeing the light of grace doth more clearly ſhine now then in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> dayes before, let us therefore goe on in our way with more ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and cheerfulneſſe of ſpirit, we having the day-light ſhining to us and guiding us. The light of the Lord is riſen up on high to guide our feet into the way of peace. Therefore as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, though they walk heavily and uncomfortably whiles they are compaſſed with darkneſſe, yet when light appeares, they goe cheerfully: ſo we that are pilgrimes and travellers, ſhould rejoyce that the day is come, as they that ſailed with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 27. we ſhould rejoyce in the light, ſtriving againſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements we meet withall, and walking on cheerfully in the way that is ſet before us.</p>
               <p>To teach us to walk more exactly &amp; inoffenſively, conſidering <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> we have our way ſo plain before us. It is no wonder if they that be in the dark ſtumble, they cannot ſee the blocks that be in their way, but they that walk in the day ſtumble not: So it ſhould be with us, we ſhould now labour to take heed of offences, both of giving and taking offences cauſleſly.<note place="margin">John 11.9.10</note> Endeavour to walk <hi>inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pede:</hi> If we ſtumble, it is not for want of light, but of heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let us ſtrive to walk evenly, conſidering wee have more light then the Saints had formerly. Labour to ſuppreſſe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate paſſions and affections, pride, worldlineſſe, ſelf-willed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, emulation: keep theſe within, theſe ſhould be like the wild beaſts of the field, which retire to their dens when the Sunne ariſeth, they are afraid to bee ſeen in the light; ſo theſe wild luſts of ours, ſhould not dare to appeare in theſe dayes of light, they cannot ſtirre forth but the light will diſcover them, ſinne is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:113533:64"/> now more conſpicuous, and more odious. Let us therefore walk ſoberly, modeſtly, and orderly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the third difference in the manner of diſpenſation is, in reſpect of power and efficacie. The diſpenſation of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant works more powerfully and ſtrongly now, then in the dayes before Chriſts comming: It was then more weak in the conſciences of Gods people then now, if we ſpeak of the body of them. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18.19. <hi>The commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment going before was diſanulled by reaſon of the weakneſſe of it;</hi> It was not then ſimply and abſolutely weak and unprofitable, ſo that it could not communicate life and ſalvation to any, but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively weak in reſpect of the lively and powerfull communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it now. Hence alſo, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.9.<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> they are called <hi>weak and beggerly rudiments.</hi> The covenant then did not bring men to that perfection in grace, as the new covenant doth. And this was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e there was a leſſe forcible influence of the Spirit accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſpenſation of the covenant then. The ſpirit was not then given in that large meaſure as now, becauſe Chriſt was not then glorified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. And becauſe the ſpirit was given in a leſs meaſure, therefore thoſe ordinances were leſſe profitable. The liberall pouring out of the Spirit was reſerved unto the time of Chriſts aſcenſion, to the end it might bee known that it is from Chriſt glorified that we doe receive the Spirit, as <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>If I goe not away</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the holy Ghoſt will not come. When Chriſt aſcended, then he gave plenitude of gifts to men, Epheſ.</hi> 4.7.8.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.7, 8.</note> Then the Spirit was ſhed down <hi>abundantly,</hi> as <hi>Titus</hi> 3.6. It was given before more ſparingly, but now more fully. And this we may ſee in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was leſs power of faith in the Saints before Chriſt, then ſince. When the doctrine of faith was more fully revealed, then was faith it ſelfe more revealed in the hearts and lives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Before faith came,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying there was a time when there was leſſe faith in Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. According to the meaſure of the manifeſtation of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, ſuch is the apprehenſion of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit of love was leſſe in them then it is now in Gods people. For according to the meaſure of our faith, ſo is our love. The leſſe they knew the loving kindneſſe of God towards them
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:113533:64"/> in Chriſt, the leſſe they loved. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.7. that <hi>God hath ſent the ſpirit of his Sonne into our hearts, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abba Father, and therefore we are no more ſervants but ſonnes, &amp;c.</hi> It was a more ſervile ſpirit which wrought in them, being drawn by the terrors of the law, more then by the promiſes of grace; but we have the ſpirit of adoption, the ſpirit <hi>of love, and of a ſound mind,</hi> as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.7.</note> Love reignes more under the diſpenſation of the covenant now, then before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They had a leſſe meaſure of comfort to ſupport and carry them on againſt the diſcouragements and troubles that they met withall: we have the comforts of the Spirit in a more full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Luke 2.</note> Chriſt is called <hi>the conſolation of Iſrael,</hi> therefore the more we have Chriſt imparted to us, the more means of comfort have we. Hence is that ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Theſe things I ſay unto you, that your joy may be full.</hi> It's a full joy which wee have now in compariſon of what they received. Therefore in theſe reſpects the diſpenſation of the covenant of grace is more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full now, then it was then.</p>
               <p>To ſtirre us up to walk in more power and fruitfulneſſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeaſons of grace wherein we live. Where there is more given, there will be more required. As God committeth more to us then to the Saints formerly; let us bring forth more fruit, or elſe the greater will our account be. It will not be enough for us to ſay, Theſe infirmities were in the people of God formerly, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and other Saints ſinned thus; and therefore though wee ſin in the ſame kind, wee may attaine life as they did. The covenant offereth us more grace, it is diſpenſed in more power and efficacie, their ſlips are for our caution, not for a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Labour to bee filled with the ſpirit of power, and of a ſound mind. Thoſe that are weak, and ſenſible of their owne infirmity, ſhould ſtrive to grow in ſtrength, that they may bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay as <hi>Micah</hi> 3.8.<note place="margin">Micah 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>I am full of power.</hi> And as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4.12.13.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>I can doe all things through the power of Chriſt.</hi> Wee muſt not bee infants and babes, but grow up to bee men in Chriſt, that the power of Chriſt may appeare to dwell in us. There is power enough in Chriſt, and we have the promiſe of all the grace that is in Chriſt, to ſupply our wants withall. Every one
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:113533:65"/> that will, may come and take freely; he is a full conduit, every one that hath an empty veſſell may goe and fill it. Doe therefore as thoſe that have their veſſels empty, and would have them fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with water, they ſet them under the conduit pipes, and there they ſtand untill they be full. Chriſt is a conduit full of grace, &amp; every ordinance is as a pipe, by which he powres into us ſome of his ſpirit. Here therefore wee muſt come and ſtand under Chriſt, that he may powre down upon us, ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd with our veſſels open, with open hearts, that we may be filled, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.3.12.<note place="margin">Zach. 4.3.12.</note> The bowles of the candleſtick ſtand under the dropping of the Olive trees, and ſo receive oyle continually to maintain their light; ſo muſt we. Chriſts divine power gives us all things that pertain to life and godlineſſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.3.</note> Let us but receive, and we may be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as we ſhould labour to be filled with the Spirit, ſo ſhould wee endeavour alſo to expreſſe the power of it in our converſation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In labouring to ſubdue our corruptions, wrath, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cy, emulation, pride, worldlineſſe, &amp;c. Let us ſet our feet upon the necks of theſe tyrants that have riſen up againſt us, and fought gainſt our ſouls. Labour to ſhew forth ſuch power of the Spirit, that we may become more then conquerours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In being filled with the power of Faith, to bear afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wants, and neceſſities, if God call us thereunto. Let us not then ſhrink and faile, but reſt upon the faithfull covenant of God, who hath promiſed us all good things for this life, and the life to come, 2 Tim. 1.8.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.8.</note> Faith will help us in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Labour to be fruitfull in all goodneſſe, endeavouring to doe good to every one, according to the meaſure received: Veſſels that are full, deſire vent, <hi>Job.</hi> 32. And if we be veſſels of mercy, filled with mercy and grace from above, we ſhould alſo vent forth to others that grace, and thoſe bleſſings which we have received. Be not like dry veſſels that will vent nothing. Be alſo patterns of goodneſſe and holineſſe unto others. In theſe things grow up <hi>to the fulneſſe of the ſtature of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, as we ſhould thus grow in the power of grace, ſo ſhould we expreſſe more of the comfort of grace, and joy of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:113533:65"/> holy Ghoſt, which is powred forth now more abundantly then before. Let us imitate that patterne, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. <hi>They walked in the feare of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> We ſhould not walk heavily and droopingly, with faces caſt down, &amp; ſpirits diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but labour to expreſſe the heavenly joy of the Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, <hi>rejoycing in Chriſt with joy unſpeakable and glorious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note> Rejoyce in the plenteous grace which is opened to us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. The Fountain is open, we may come and take freely. Look how it would joy a poore man, if a rich friend ſhould ſay unto him, Come unto me in all your wants, I will help you: ſo ſhould it be with us, though we are poore and in wants, yet we have a rich friend in heaven, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and hee will open the rich treaſure of his goodneſſe to us, if we goe unto him.</p>
               <p>The fourth difference is, in regard of the extent of it: The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace in the old diſpenſation of it, was revealed onely unto one people, the nation of the Jewes, but now it is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Gentiles alſo, and free to bee revealed to all nations. There was a long time wherein the Gentiles knew nothing of this covenant between God and man, but walked in darkneſſe, and in the vanity of their mind, and therefore they are called, <hi>The Gentiles which knew not God,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.5.<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4.5.</note> And, <hi>Gentiles in the fleſh, Epheſ.</hi> 2.11<note place="margin">Eph. 2.11.</note> And ſaid to be <hi>without Chriſt, without promiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out covenant;</hi> yea, to be <hi>without hope, Epheſ.</hi> 2.12.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> For being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, who is <hi>our hope,</hi> they muſt needs bee without hope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. We may ſee in the Scripture, how that (during all the time of the old Teſtament) all the holy things of God by which life and ſalvation are conveyed, are appropriated to the Jewes alone: The law is called <hi>their Law, John</hi> 8.17.<note place="margin">John 8.17.</note> And, <hi>the inheritance of the children of Jacob, Deut.</hi> 33.4.<note place="margin">Deut. 33.4.</note>

                  </label> Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Humility, the doctrine of grace is revealed to us that were Gentiles in the fleſh, without Chriſt, without hope, wee were aliens, an abject, a baſe, and rejected people, not the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Let us remember our baſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, remember the rock whence we were hewen, the wild na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Olive which wee grew upon, and let this make us humble and lowly in our own eyes. We are ready to think we are
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:113533:67"/> the onely people. If we begin to be arrogant, then call to minde what we were, <hi>ſtrangers from God, and aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael.</hi> This we had need to remember our ſelves of. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it needfull to put the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in mind of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.11.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.11.</note> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> cap. 11. and the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. there is the ſame ſpirit in us; we had need therefore to looke back to what we were, that ſo we may not be high minded, but feare, leaſt for our pride and unprofitableneſſe, we be left in the ſame eſtate we were in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thankfulneſſe unto God, that whereas our Fathers ſate in darkneſſe for many hundred yeares together, yet the grace of God is revealed unto us. Be aboundantly thankfull for it, that we which were dogs before, are now ſet at the childrens table; He hath made knowne his Covenant to us, which was kept ſecret from ages before, wherein though they would have been glad to have ſeen and heard the things which we doe; yet they could not; what doe wee owe unto God for this mercy? Doe therefore as they in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48.<note place="margin">Acts 13.48.</note> they were glad and rejoyced that the Goſpel was preached to them; ſo let us. Let us alſo praiſe and glorifie God for it, as the Gentiles are ſtirred up to doe; <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.9, 10. when the <hi>Jewes</hi> heard that God had given the Gentiles repentance unto life, they glorified God; much more ſhould we doe it for our ſelves.</p>
               <p>And thirdly; Let us learne to give up our ſelves to the obedience of Grace, as they did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. This is that the Goſpel teacheth, 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 11.12. There is much profeſſion of faith in <hi>New England,</hi> but let it appeare in the life; manifeſt our thankfulneſſe in our obedience of the Goſpel of Chriſt; or elſe the more the Grace of God is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us, the heavier will our judgement be. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>God will come in flaming fire, rendring vengeance to them that obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Here might be noted a fifth Difference, that the old Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nt was to laſt but for a time, till the time of reformation, <hi>Heb.</hi>

                  </gap>.4. but the new Covenant is to laſt for ever to the end of the world. Which makes againſt the opinion of thoſe which teach the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ordinances of the New Teſtament, at the ſetting up of Chriſts kingdome which they plead for; but this I paſſe by. It is an everlaſting Goſpel, and the ordinances of it everlaſting, to laſt as long as the world ſhall laſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now follows a third point concerning the covenant of grace,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:113533:67"/> to be ſpoken to; and that is touching the bleſſings and benefits of the Covenant. And theſe are neceſſary to be conſidered of, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into, for ſundry reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That thoſe that are in covenant with God, might know the great things which are given unto us of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. Now we can never know the things which are given unto us of God, but by knowing of the covenant which conveys all the bleſſings which God doth impart unto his people; therefore it is neceſſary that we ſhould know the bleſſings of the Covenant, that ſo wee may take comfort in them; rejoyce in them, and ſee our owne happineſſe, what an happy thing it is to be in covenant with God; Men that have great poſſeſſions, will ſometimes get upon the top of ſome high place, to take a view of their large revenewes; ſo ſhould wee aſcend on high in our Meditations, to conſider the great bleſſings which the Lord paſſes over unto us by his Covenant. Wee ſhould doe as <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſes,</hi> get up to the top of Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> and view all the land, all the ſeverall bleſſings of the Covenant; And as God bids <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 13.17. to view the length and breadth of the land which he would give unto him; ſo ſhould we view the length and breadth of the promiſe; Walke through the Covenant as wee are able, to ſee the heighth and depth of it, that ſo we may know what great things the Lord hath made us poſſeſſors of, and ſo rejoyce in our portion, and take conſolation therein. Indeed we can here behold them but as in a Map darkly, wee muſt reſerve the full view of them till wee come to injoy them, as they ſhall be exhibited to us hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be uſefull alſo to others, that are ſtrangers to the Covenant and promiſes, that they by hearing how great the bleſſings of the Covenant are, they may be allured and drawne thereby to come and take hold of the covenant, whereby ſuch great and wonderfull things are communicated unto them. This drawes ſome, when they ſee the goodneſſe of God unto his people, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.23.<note place="margin">Zach 8.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.9. And thereby they are encouraged to joyne unto them, and become one people with them. This ſtird <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelfe, to conſider their happineſſe, and to ſay, <hi>How goodly are thy Tents. O Jacob!</hi> and therefore wiſhed, <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous.</hi> This doth many times efficaciouſly worke upon the hearts of thoſe that are without the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The conſideration of the Benefits of the Covenant, will
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:113533:68"/> helpe to make the burthen of it (as it ſeemes burthenſome to fleſh and bloud) more light, and the bonds more eaſie. If we looke at the bond of the Covenant alone, we ſhall be ready to ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3.<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us breake theſe bonds, and caſt theſe cords from us.</hi> But if we look into the bleſſings of the Covenant which it brings, theſe will make the bonds more eaſie, that the ſoule will ſay, Lord bind me as faſt as thou wilt, that I may never ſtart from thee; knit my heart unto thee, that I may feare thee for ever. It will make the ſervice of the Covenant an eaſie ſervitude, yea it will make us ſee glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it. If this be conſidered, we ſhall not ſay, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. and <hi>Job</hi> 21.15. <hi>What profit is it, that wee have ſerved the Lord, and kept his ordinances, &amp;c?</hi> but that in <hi>keeping his Covenant there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Pſal. 19.<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whereas the Lord doth caſt in many bleſſings upon his people, ſpirituall and temporall, (the Lord dealing in all his wayes towards his people according to his Covenant with them) now the conſideration of the many bleſſings which wee doe enjoy by the Covenant, will lead us to the right fountaine from whence we doe receive them, even to ſee the faithfulneſſe of God in them, who keeps covenant and promiſe with his people; Wee ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſee, that as he hath ſpoken it with his mouth, ſo he hath fulfilled it with his hand.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The knowledge of the bleſſings of the Covenant will helpe to ſupport our faith in all tryalls, exigencies, and ſtraights, which we fall into; if we know what the promiſes of the covenant be, it will beare us up that our faith faint not, though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we be cut ſhort of the bleſſings which wee have a promiſe for. Herein faith is ſupported, that though God may try us, yet he will not forſake us, if the bleſſing be not <hi>yet come,</hi> yet it <hi>will come,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile, the Covenant being faithfull; the Lord <hi>will</hi> perform mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to <hi>Jacob</hi> and truth to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Micah 7. laſt. Thus it is every way uſefull and profitable to know the bleſſings of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And here lift up our hearts to looke for great things, great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſuch as the great God hath promiſed; the bleſſings are ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the perſon that we enter into Covenant withall; The things of the Covenant are great things, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.12.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 8.12.</note> Princes and Monarches when they enter into Covenant with other Nations, they doe not make Covenants about childrens toyes and light matters, but ſuch
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:113533:68"/> as concerne the welfare of the Kingdome; ſo when the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of heaven and earth enters into Covenant with us, it is about the great things of our ſalvation, the great things of heaven, yea of God himſelfe. The Covenant is full of bleſſings, it is a rich ſtore-houſe, repleniſhed with all manner of bleſſings. It is not dry nor barren, but like the fat Olive or fruitfull Vine, the fruit whereof cheares the heart of God and man. God himſelfe is delighted in the communication of his grace to his people; and <hi>they</hi> are delighted with the participation of his grace from him. The Covenant is a tree of life to thoſe that feed upon it, they ſhall live for ever. It is a Well of ſalvation, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 12.3.<note place="margin">Iſai. 12.3.</note> It's a fountaine of good things to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie every thirſtie ſoule, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1.<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> It is a treaſure full of goods, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.12. Here is unſearchable riches in this Covenant, which can never be emptied, nor come to an end. Our finite narrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings can never apprehend the infinite grace this Covenant containes, no more then an egge-ſhell is able to containe the water of the whole Sea. Yet it is not in vaine to conſider them as wee are able to expreſſe them, though they be above that which we are able to ſpeake or thinke. As <hi>Moſes</hi> though he could not ſee Gods face, nor diſcerne his glory to the full, yet he was permitted to ſee his back parts; ſo we may take a little view of the bleſſings promiſed, though the full cannot be ſeene. As in a Map, we have the bounds of a Lordſhip ſet forth, the rivers, woods, meadowes, paſtures, &amp;c. theſe are ſeen darkly in the Map, but they are nothing to that when they are ſeen in their own beautie and greenneſſe; to ſee the ſilver ſtreames in the rivers, the beautifull woods, the large medowes, fat paſtures, and goodly orchards, which are farre more excellent in themſelves, then when they are ſeene in the Map. So we can ſhew you but a little Map of thoſe glorious things which the Covenant containes; but by that little that you doe ſee, you may be raiſed up to the conſideration of the things that are not ſeene, but are to be revealed in due time.</p>
               <p>Now the bleſſings of the Covenant are infolded and wrapped up in the promiſes of it, every promiſe of Grace containing a bleſſing in it, as every threatning of the Law contains a curſe. They are now infolded in the promiſe, the time of unfolding is not yet come. The time of full diſcovery is when the heavens come to be folded up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.12.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.12.</note> then the promiſes ſhall be unfolden, and then wee ſhall
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:113533:69"/> fully ſee the bleſſings of the Covenant: Wee have now a right and intereſt in them, which is ſafe and ſure, but as yet we have them but by promiſe onely; and therefore it is, that the termes of <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>promiſe,</hi> are taken for the ſame, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. Hence alſo we are ſaid to be heires (in hope) of eternall life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7.<note place="margin">Titus 3.7.</note> not in preſent poſſeſſion, but in hope. Therefore if wee would ſee what are the bleſſings of the Covenant, we muſt looke into the promiſes; Now the promiſes and bleſſings of the Covenant, are of two ſorts; Firſt, of things ſpirituall and eternall. Secondly, of things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that concerne this outward life. The ſpirituall bleſſings of the Covenant are chiefly comprehended in theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31.33.<note place="margin">Jer 31.31.33.</note> 
                  <hi>This ſhall be my Covenant, ſaith the Lord, after thoſe dayes, I will put my Law in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. And they ſhall teach no more every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſaying, Know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them, to the greateſt of them; for I will forgive their iniquitie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ſinne no more.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27, 28.<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.25, 26, 27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Then will I ſprinkle cleane water upon you, and yee ſhall be cleane from all your filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and from all your Idolls will I cleanſe you; A new heart alſo will I give you, &amp;c.</hi> So alſo, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.38, 39, 40. <hi>They ſhall be my people, and I will be their God: and I will give them one heart, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 17.7.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> 
                  <hi>I will be a God unto thee, and thy ſeed.</hi> Theſe places compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ſuch other, doe expreſſe the ſumme of all the great things promiſed in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Here is that great promiſe, <hi>I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, But if any ſay, Alas, how can God be a God unto me ſo ſinfull as I am, that have ſinned &amp; provoked him as I have done, therefore to take away this, God ſaith, that ſhall not hinder, <hi>I will forgive your iniquities, and remember them no more.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Firſt, it we conſider what it is that is given: it is no leſſe then the great, mighty, and infinite God.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, it is more grace ſtill, becauſe his entring into this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with us, his beſtowing of this grace, is of himſelfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of his own good will and pleaſure, without our ſeeking or enquiring for him.

               <p n="3">3. That he will be God over us, to bring us again under the firſt dominion; as <hi>Micah.</hi> 4.8.<note place="margin">Micah 4.8.</note> to rule over us, and govern us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the firſt, that God will be an All-ſufficient God to us, this is a part of his covenant, that he will be to us a full bleſſing, ſo as that we ſhall bee wanting in nothing that is good for us. Hence it is,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> that when God tells <hi>Abraham, He will be his God, and the God of his ſeed,</hi> if <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould now ask what that is; ſaith God, verſe 1. <hi>I am God All-ſufficient,</hi> and alſo my goodneſſe and ſufficiency is thine, I will bee enough to thee, thou ſhalt need no more. Hence alſo is that in <hi>Jeremy</hi> 31.14. <hi>I will ſatiate your ſoule with fatneſſe, and my people ſhall be ſatisfied with goodneſſe, ſaith the Lord.</hi> God is enough to them that are his.</p>

                  </label> Becauſe he is ſufficient to his own bleſſedneſſe, and therefore much more unto ours. He needs no creature to adde unto him. The greater any one is in ſtate and dignity, the more he ſtands in need of,<note place="margin">Pſalm 16.3.</note> to be a ſufficient fulneſſe unto him. That is too little for a Prince, which is enough for a private man. Now God is the moſt excellent Being, and therefore that which is ſufficient for himſelfe, muſt needs much more be ſo for us. That water which fills the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a, will much more fill a cup; and therefore ſaid <hi>David</hi> when he enjoyed God, <hi>My cup runneth over, Pſal.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe what ever good is in the creature, is more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently and abundantly in God himſelfe: hee is the Fountain, and they are the Ciſterns. What ever good is in Angels or Men, or other creatures, is more abundantly in God. And therefore if all the good of all creatures joyned together, were able to ſatisfie and to be ſufficient for a man (as we would think it were) then is God much more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is in God a ſutableneſſe to the deſires of the ſoul of man. It is the happineſſe of the creature to have a thing ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it: Now the ſoule being made after the Image of God, it is beſt ſatisfied with God, and nothing elſe can ſatisfie it. As no
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:113533:73"/> creature ſatisfied <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Eve</hi> was made, that was ſuitable to him. Similitude breeds content. The ſoul is a ſpirit, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt nature, reaching after the knowledge of high and hidden things: Now God is light and wiſdome to ſati fie the ſoule in this, by filling it with light by the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Again, the ſoule is an immortall ſubſtance, which dies not, and the deſires of it are immortall: So is God, therein ſatisfying our ſoules d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſires.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if God be our God, then all the creatures are ours, and for our good. If God bee ours, then all that is his is ours: now all the creatures are his. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>end; All things are yours.</hi> As when a virgin marrieth a Prince, his riches, glory, and all are for her good: So God having taken us into covenant with himſelfe, all that hee is, and hath, is for our comfort and bleſſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>As God is <hi>able</hi> thus to be an All-ſufficient God to us, ſo he <hi>will be</hi> to thoſe that are his.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is the nature of goodneſſe to bee communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of it ſelf; and therefore God being good, he will let out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto his people. He cannot ſatisfie himſelf unleſſe he doe it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lords end in taking us into covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, is to make us an happy and bleſſed people, which wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but onely by the enjoyment of God himſelf; bleſſedneſſe ſtanding in a confluence of all good, which cannot be found but in God alone. There is in man himſelfe nothing but vanity and miſery: he was at firſt full of grace and goodneſſe, an Image of the bleſſed God, but now he is become a ſpectacle of miſery. So all other things under the Sun are to him turned to vanity and vexation of ſpirit. As a deale of wind in the body doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh it, but gripe and pain it: ſo all the windy comforts of the world cannot ſatisfie, but rather trouble us, till we recover our fellowſhip with God. As we loſt our felicity in loſing God; ſo we muſt recover it again by recovering him. Therefore wee find in experience, that the ſoule never finds ſetled teſt, till it come to reſt in God. As the Bee goes from flower to flower, becauſe there is not full contentment to be found in any one: ſo the ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from creature to creature, til it comes to God. Hence the Lord is called
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:113533:74"/> the <hi>reſt of the ſoule, Pſalm</hi> 116.7. And this the Lord knowing, that the ſoule cannot find reſt any where elſe, but in him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>will</hi> communicate himſelf to them: this being his end, to make the creature bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſed by enjoying of him.</p>
               <p>Conſider how God is an All-ſufficient God to us in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:</p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of all our occaſions and neceſſities, whatever our caſe be. It's Gods prerogative alone to be an univerſal good. The things of the world can help but againſt ſome one thing; bread againſt hunger, drink againſt thirſt, cloathes againſt cold and nakedneſſe, houſes againſt wind and weather, friends againſt ſolitarineſſe, riches againſt poverty, Phyſick againſt ſickneſſe &amp;c. But God is an All-ſufficient good, he ſupplies all the neceſſities of his people, he is all in all to them, he is habitation to them, he is life, &amp;c. he doth good to the inward and outward man; his grace is ſufficient to help all the defects of the ſoule. Look upon the guilt of ſinne, there is abundant grace to pardon: Are our infirmities many? there is power in Gods grace to heale them. Are our corruptions ſtrong? the power of Gods Spirit can overcome them, and make us able to keep his Statutes and Judgements, and to doe them. Are our conſciences diſquieted, and our peace broken? His joy is able to make us rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious.</p>
               <p>Again, his ſufficiency extends alſo to the body: all the welfare of the outward man is laid up in God; he is the God of our life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.8.<note place="margin">Pſalm 42.8.</note> and the ſtrength of our life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1.<note place="margin">Pſalm 27.1.</note> He is a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.45.</note> which though it be true in regard of the inward man, which he doth alſo quicken by his Spirit and grace; yet it is there ſpoken of the outward man, of the body which the Lord ſhall quicken after death, and doth now keep alive by his power. <hi>For in him we live, and move, and have our being, Acts</hi> 17.28.<note place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note> When God formed the body at firſt out of the duſt, whence had it life? Not from it ſelfe, nor from any creature: <hi>God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed into him the breath of life:</hi> and ſo he ſtill keeps the breath in our noſtrils, and upholds our ſoule in life, or elſe we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently return to duſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is an all-ſufficient good in reſpect of all times and ſeaſons, both for this life and the life to come. Other things
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:113533:74"/> ſerve but in their ſeaſons, as it was ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> that he ſerved his time; ſo doe the things of this life, but they continue not, our health and ſtrength are with us in youth, but they ſtay not. The flowers give their ſmell in the ſpring, but by and by they are withered and gone. The Sunne gives light in the day time, but hides it ſelfe in the night; cloathes keep us warme, but they wear away. But God is a laſting, yea and an everlaſting good; <hi>He is God and changeth not,</hi> and therefore is called, <hi>God from everlaſting to everlaſting, Pſal.</hi> 90.2. In a word, he is ſufficient,</p>
               <p>Firſt, to ſave us from all evill, and thence hee is ſaid to bee a <hi>Wall of fire round about his people, Zach.</hi> 2.8. So alſo a <hi>Cloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the heat, a Shield and Buckler againſt the Sword, &amp;c.</hi> an all-ſufficient protection to his people againſt all evill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, an all-ſufficient good to communicate all bleſſings to us which we ſtand in need of; therefore hee promiſes to open his good treaſure.<note place="margin">Deut. 28.11.12.</note> And hee tells <hi>Abraham</hi> when hee enters into covenant with him, that he <hi>will be his exceeding great reward. I will be all things to thee.</hi> Hence the Lord is called a <hi>Sunne, Pſalm</hi> 84. that as the Sun is the cauſe of all fruitfulneſſe to the earth, bringeth forth corn, graſſe, and hearbs, and withall cheriſhes them: ſo the Lord by the influence of his grace and goodneſſe, bringeth forth ſomething out of every creature for the good and comfort of his people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he is able to make up all our loſſes; whatever wee have forgone for his Names ſake, and his Goſpels, we ſhall have an hundred fold more either in the ſame kind, or in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or inward peace of conſcience. Thus the Prophet tells <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. when he asked what he ſhould doe for the hundred talents, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>The Lord is able to give thee more then this.</hi> Have we with <hi>Abraham</hi> forſaken our native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and our kindred? The Lord is able to make up all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He is ſufficient to work for us and by us, what ever we deſire according to his will. What ever enterpriſe wee have in hand, or goe about, though wee have mountaines againſt us, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.7. yet the Lord can make them plains, and work all our works for us. Have we any grace to bee wrought in us? Hee can make <hi>all grace to abound in us.</hi> He hath abundance of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.21.</note> and can <hi>work both will and deed.</hi> Thus you ſee that <hi>God is every way ſufficient to his people.</hi>
               </p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> This may let us ſee both the cauſe and cure of thoſe manifold diſcontents that we meet withall in our daily courſe, troubled we are on every ſide, nothing ſatisfies the unſatiable deſires of our hearts, but when we have the things we ſought at Gods hand, yet we are diſcontented. The reaſon of all is, becauſe we doe not injoy God, we doe not live upon him, wee doe not poſſeſſe nor improve our intereſt in him. We pore upon the Creature, and place our reſt there, and ſo miſſe of our expectation. If we did injoy God in our daily converſation, wee might finde a ſufficiency and contentment in every eſtate, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> He lived to God, and enjoyed him, and he was an all-ſufficient good to him. Wee may injoy God in any condition, in the meaneſt as well as the greateſt, in the pooreſt as well as the richeſt. Nothing can ſeparate us from God but ſin alone. God will goe into a wilderneſſe, into a priſon, into a low condition with his people, and he is able to make up all to them that they are cut ſhort of. Our diſcontents therefore doe not ariſe from the change of our condition in outward things, but becauſe we want our fellowſhip with God. If we doe not finde a ſufficiency, it is becauſe we doe not injoy him our all-ſufficient good. What is the cure then? We muſt ſtirre up our faith, and conſider our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, thinke with our ſelves what God hath promiſed to be to us, even our God, our all-ſufficient good. If wee had faith but as a graine of Muſtard ſeed, and did exerciſe our faith in this promiſe, and live by it, wee might command theſe ſtormes of diſcontent which trouble us, to be at peace and be ſtill. We might then ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11.<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.11.</note>

                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:113533:76"/>3. The lives of Gods people are not to be judged of, by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but by their inward ſtate and condition; many a man lives poorely for outward things in this world, and yet finds more ſufficiency and fulneſſe in that eſtate, then many a man that hath barnes full, and fares deliciouſly every day. For firſt, they have neceſſaries as well as they that have more, though but little before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. They have every day a certain proviſion prepared for them: As the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> provided for <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 36.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36.</note> Again, though Gods ſervants have many times but little, yet they have as much comfort in that little, as thoſe that have greater abundance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16. They have as much peace, quiet of heart and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as free from feare and care, as chearfull and comfortable, and finde as good a ſavour in that homely proviſion they feed upon, as others in their honey-combe. And whence is all this, but from hence, that the fulneſſe of God is in that little which they enjoy? There is a full bleſſing in it, God hath put himſelfe into it, and though it be but little and mean in ſhew, yet it is much in ſubſtance. And laſtly, If Gods ſervants want at any time, he ſees a little to be better for them then more abundance, not becauſe God cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill their neceſſitie, or is not willing; he is able to ſupply their wants, and will in due time adminiſter all Grace to them.

The veſſell may give you water, but not from it ſelfe, but what it hath from the fountaine; the fountaine onely gives it from it ſelfe. So it is between God and the creature.

Thus <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> when he had neither bread nor water for fortie dayes, yet he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and was as ſtrong as though he had daily eaten his appointed food. So alſo was it with <hi>Elijah,</hi> and our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.2. So alſo with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God ſuffered them to be hungry, and yet they did not famiſh, that it might appeare, that man lives not by bread onely, but by every word of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. Hence is that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.17, 18.20.<note place="margin">Iſai. 41.17, 18.20.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord will open rivers in the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and fountaines in the valleyes, for the poore and needy,</hi> &amp;c. And for what end will the Lord doe this? that they may know and conſider, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, &amp;c. Thus was the Lord
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:113533:77"/> good to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſſe, he was all things to them. Firſt, they had no ſetled habitation, but the Lord was an habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.1.<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.1.</note> Againe, they had no ordinary bread for fortie yeares together, and yet they were preſerved alive, that they might know that the Lord was the God of their welfare, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.6.<note place="margin">Deut. 29.6.</note> Againe, they had no meanes of renewing their cloathing, and yet they wanted not; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.5. <hi>Their cloathes waxed not old upon them, nor their ſhooes upon their feet.</hi> Againe, they were often to journey and travell by night as well as by day, and they knew not one foot of the way they ſhould goe, therefore the Lord himſelfe was a guide unto them, <hi>He went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night,</hi> Exod. 13.21.<note place="margin">Exod. 13.21.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord fulfilled that which he ſpeakes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.17.<note place="margin">Iſai. 48.17.</note> 
                  <hi>I the Lord thy redeemer lead thee in the way wherein thou ſhouldeſt goe.</hi> Hence is that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.10.12. <hi>The Lord</hi> alone <hi>led him, and there was no ſtrange God with him.</hi> He <hi>alone</hi> provided for them, he <hi>alone</hi> fed them, he <hi>alone</hi> conducted them, he <hi>alone</hi> did all for them.</p>
               <p>As it is thus in temporall benefits, ſo alſo in ſpirituall bleſſings, the Lord is from himſelfe all in all unto his people. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.16.<note place="margin">Ezek. 11.16.</note> the Lord tells them, that <hi>he would carry them into captivitie,</hi> and now leſt they ſhould be diſcouraged for want of the Temple and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, therefore the Lord promiſes, that <hi>he will be a Sanctuary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them;</hi> he will ſupply unto them the want of publique ordinances from himſelfe. Hence is that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.17.<note place="margin">Iſai. 54.17.</note> it is ſaid that they ſhall be <hi>taught of God;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> that the ſpirit helpes the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods people; when the ſervants of God would pray, but they cannot, the Spirit himſelfe maketh up their wants, and fills their hearts with groanes which pierce the heavens. So when they are to ſpeake before the adverſaries of Gods truth, and they know not how to anſwer, then the Lord puts an anſwer into their mouthes, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.20.</note> So alſo in the preaching of the Word, the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe puts words into the mouthes of his ſervants, that whereas they may ſay as <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 4.10. <hi>I am of a ſtammering tongue and cannot ſpeake,</hi> or as <hi>Jer. cap.</hi> 1.6. <hi>I am a childe, &amp;c.</hi> yet the Lord is a mouth unto them, and they ſpeake words not which mans wiſdome teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.13.</note> that they which heare them are forced to ſay, God is in you of a truth. So alſo in the comfort and peace that God giveth unto his ſervants, he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:113533:77"/> giveth it not as the world giveth, by abundance of earthly comforts and outward proſperitie, but when all things threaten trouble, yet then he gives peace from himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27.<note place="margin">Joh. 14.27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider how God is all to his people from himſelfe, even in the poſſeſſion &amp; enjoyment of his good bleſſings; ſometimes the Lord continues to us the meanes of life, and yet ſo workes and orders all, that the benefit and bleſſing is evidently ſeene to come not from them, but from the Lord alone; And this he maketh to appeare divers wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sometimes God lets us enjoy the creature, and yet wee want the bleſſing for a ſeaſon, till he command a bleſſing to come. Sometimes we have raine, but not the raine of bleſſing, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he cauſeth it to come in mercy, and to become a bleſſing. The Sunne ſhineth in the firmament, but we want the heat of it, the warmth and quickning power of it is withheld, to let us ſee that it is not the Sunne, but the Lord, by which we doe enjoy the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. We caſt our ſeed into the ground, but it doth not proſper, afterward it growes and flouriſheth. Sometimes we carry out much, and bring in little, what is the reaſon? It is to let us ſee the truth of that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.7.</note> that <hi>it is the Lord which giveth the increaſe.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we carry out little, and bring in great increaſe, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.10.12. The reaſon is, it is the Lord who giveth us to poſſeſſe all things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sometimes the Lord gives us the meanes by which we live, but it is in ſuch a ſtrange and unwonted manner and way, that the hand of God is as evidently ſeene in the giving of the meanes, as if he had upholden our life without meanes. Thus <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.12.<note place="margin">Exod. 16.12.</note> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a kinde of bread in the wilderneſſe, but it was in ſuch a ſtrange and miraculous manner, as though they had lived fortie yeares without any food. The uſuall way by which we have bread, is out of the earth; according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.14.<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.14.</note> But the bread by which God fed them, was bread from heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.40. As if God had made heaven a garner or ſtore-houſe, to lay up Corne for the neceſſities of his people. So <hi>Elijah</hi> was fed with bread and fleſh, which are ordinary food, but the meanes by which he had them were as ſtrange as though he had lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. God appointed the Ravens there to feed him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:113533:78"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Sometimes God gives ſome meanes to his people to enjoy, but the meanes are weake and feeble and unable to worke for our good and comfort, without a ſpeciall bleſſing from himſelfe. Here therefore the Lord comes in, and puts his own ſtrength to the weakneſſe of the meanes, and makes them worke for us aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, above that which we could expect or thinke. Thus when <hi>Daniel</hi> refuſed to eat the Kings meat, and choſe pulſe, thin grewel or hearbs, or ſuch courſe ſtuffe, yet his countenance was better liking, then they that did eat of the Kings meat; their well liking came not from the meat, but from an extraordinary bleſſing that came from God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Dan. 1.</note> So <hi>Gideon</hi> muſt have Souldiers and weapons of warre, and yet ſuch a ſmall company, and weake furniture, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be forced to ſay, <hi>I have not wrought ſalvation for my ſelfe, but it is the Lord that hath done it.</hi> So it is in ſpirituall meanes. God ſometimes gives but weake meanes to a people in compariſon of what others doe enjoy, yet many are turned to God by their miniſtry. As by the ſound of the trumpets of Rammes hornes, the walles of <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> fell downe, ſo by the miniſtry of weake man the Lord throwes downe the ſtrong hold of Satans kingdome, to the end that the excellency of the power, may appeare to be of God, not of man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Againe, ſometimes the Lord increaſeth and lengthens out the little and ſhort proviſions which he makes for his people, ſo that by reaſon of the increaſe which it receiveth from God, it is made as ſufficient, as if it were an hundred or thouſand-fold more. Thus with the woman of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> 1 King. 17.14.<note place="margin">1 King. 17.14.</note> the Lord increaſed the meale in the barrell, and the oyle in the cruſe, that it failed not, till the day that the Lord ſent raine upon the earth. Thus it was alſo with the widow that was in debt, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.3. ſhee had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay withall, but a pot of oyle, yet the Lord ſo multiplyed it, that there wanted not oyle, till there wanted veſſells to receive it. The Lord ſometimes cauſeth the little proviſions which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for his people, ſo to laſt, that they want not meat, till they want bellyes to receive it. Thus alſo it was with thoſe five thouſand that our Saviour fed with a few loaves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. And ſo alſo with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.5. that when no ſupplies of cloathing could be made to them, then the Lord made that ſuit of apparell upon their backe, and thoſe ſhooes which were upon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:113533:78"/> their feet to continue; this was by the bleſſing of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Sometimes the Lord giveth the ſame meanes to one as to another; But there is a great difference in the comfort and bleſſing which is injoyed by the one and by the other. One hath food, ſo hath another, but one eates and is ſatisfied, as the Lord promiſeth that his people ſhall be, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.26.<note place="margin">Joel 2.26.</note> the other eates, and is not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as he threatneth, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.10. One is ſtrengthned, and growes ſtrong to labour, the other is impotent and feeble. The Lord here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhewes, that the being ſatisfied and receiving ſtrength, is not from the meanes, but from the bleſſing which he is pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to his people from himſelfe. So it is alſo in the meanes of grace, many people enjoy the ſame externall meanes, the ſame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, the ſame exhortation and promiſes; ſome are thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and turned unto God; others remaine blind, ignorant, and carnall; the reaſon is, becauſe that as the one ſeekes not unto God but onely unto man, ſo man onely ſpeakes to the one, but to the other God ſpeakes by his own Spirit, and workes from himſelfe over and above that which man doth or can doe. Thus we ſee that both in the want, and in the poſſeſſion of the meanes, the Lord is all to his people from himſelfe. Now the reaſons why the Lord doth thus worke from himſelfe are; Firſt, for the glorifying of himſelfe. Secondly, for the comfort of his people.</p>
               <p>For the glorifying of himſelfe, to make his goodneſſe and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> the more to appeare to his people, that they may know that he is not as man, tyed to meanes, or to the greatneſſe and power of them, but he is an all-ſufficient God; and therefore ſhould give him all the praiſe; and for this very end doth the Lord ſometimes bring his ſervants into ſtraits, beyond the helpe of any creature, that when they are brought forth, it might appeare that it is the hand of the Lord that hath done it. When as the Lord either puts us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the meanes, or cuts them ſhort, he doth in effect thus ſay to us, I have hitherto wrought for you, but it hath been by ſuch and ſuch meanes, which have been as a vaile between me and you, that you have not ſeene my power and goodneſſe towards you ſo clearely, but now I will ſhew my ſelfe more fully to you. Now I will take away thoſe things which though you counted helps to your ſelves, yet are hindrances to hinder me, that I cannot ſhew my ſelfe ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to you. I will now therefore lay them aſide, and by my
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:113533:79"/> ſelfe, I will work for your good. The Lord herein deales with his ſervants, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did with his brethren. Whileſt he walked more ſtrangely towards them, and ſpake to them by an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo long he ſuffered his ſervants, and as many as would, to bee preſent, he cared not how many were ſtanding by; but when hee meant to let them know that he was <hi>Joſeph</hi> their brother, when hee would open all his heart to them, and let them ſee his abundant love, then ſaith <hi>Joſeph, Cauſe every man to goe out from me, Gen.</hi> 45.1. So it is here, whiles the Lord comes to us, by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward and ordinary means, he converſeth with us but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrangely, ſpeaking as by ſo many Interpreters, by them to interpret his mind and will to us; but when hee will ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to us more fami iarly, then he bids away unto all theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer means, ſilver, gold, and corn, &amp;c. and when all theſe are ſet aſide, then he comes and ſayes plainly, Now you ſhall ſee what I my ſelfe will doe for you; and that I, who am the Lord all-ſuffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ient, am the Lord your God, and <hi>from my ſelfe</hi> I will bleſſe you, you ſhall now ſee my immediate care of you. And when the Lords people ſee this, thereby they know him better, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him more, thereby are they forced to ſay, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 148.13.<note place="margin">Pſal. 148.13.</note> 
                  <hi>His Name onely is excellent, his Name onely is worthy to bee exalted.</hi> Before they were ready to aſcribe ſome excellency to the means and inſtruments, ſacrificing to their own nets: but when <hi>they</hi> come to nothing, and the <hi>Lord</hi> hath by <hi>himſelfe</hi> fulfilled our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, then are we lifted up to glorifie him, hee alone is ſeen to be an all ſufficient God unto his people. So that if wee ask, Why is the Lord alone in doing good to his people, and there is none with him, as <hi>David</hi> was asked, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 21.1.</note> The anſwer is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>I will not give my glory to another,</hi> ſaith God, but will have my whole glory to my ſelfe alone: He is alone, that he alone may be glorified.</p>
               <p>

So when the Lord caſteth in kindneſſe and favours upon his people from himſelfe, this is more comfortable then to have it by another means. Indeed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, as wee are not able to guide our ſelves, ſo there is no other creature that can guide us aright unto life, as the Lord ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.18. <hi>There is none to guide her among all the ſons which ſhe hath brought forth &amp;c.</hi> They may perh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whereas when they are led by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own hearts, then there is nothing but confuſion and diſturbance. It is a miſery that cometh upon a people, when God will not guide them, but withdrawes his government over them. When there was no King in Iſrael, then they had many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, many troubles; much more is it ſo in ſpirituall regards, when God leaves us to the wandrings of our own hearts, how many miſeries and ſinnes are we ſubject unto? This was their curſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.24.</note> to be given up unto themſelves, and then they ran into all manner of wickedneſſe. And this was the miſery of the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17.<note place="margin">Acts 14.17.</note> that God ſuffered them to walk in their own wayes. Hence the Church complains. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63. <hi>laſt.</hi>

Indeed, there is a ſpirituall <hi>liberty</hi> from our enemies, but there is <hi>ſubjection</hi> required to the Lord. Wee muſt not looke onely after gifts, mercies, kindneſſes, pardon, and ſuch tokens and pledges of grace, but looke alſo for this, to be under God, and to ſet up him on high to be a God and Lord over us; And let us not count this our miſery, but our bleſſedneſſe, that wee are brought under his gracious government. Herein the Lord ſheweth his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous kindneſſe, that he will take the care of us; Would wee not wonder to ſee ſuch a Prince as <hi>Solomon,</hi> to take his ſubjects children to tutour them and traine them up under him?

               </p>
               <p>By theſe foure things we may know it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Where the Lord ſets himſelfe over a people, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> he frames them unto a willing and voluntary ſubjection unto him, that they deſire nothing more then to be under his government, they count this their felicity, that they have the Lord over them, to governe them. As the ſervants of <hi>Solomon</hi> were counted happie that they might ſtand before him, and miniſter unto him; ſo it is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods people, that they are under him, and in ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: The Lords government is not a <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like tyranny, to rule them with rigour, and make them ſigh and groane, but it is a government of peace; he rules them by love, as he firſt winnes them by love. He conquers them indeed by a mighty ſtrong hand, but withall he drawes them by the cords of love. He overcometh our evill with the abundance of his goodneſſe; therefore his ſpirit, though ſometime it be called a ſpirit of power, yet it is alſo a ſpirit of love, joy, and peace; though the ſpirit put forth his power in vanquiſhing our <hi>enemies</hi> that held us in bondage, yet it overcometh <hi>us</hi> by love, making us to ſee what a bleſſed thing it is to have the Lord to be over us. Thus when the Lord is in Covenant with a people, they follow him not forcedly, but as farre as they are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by grace, they ſubmit willingly to his regiment. Therefore thoſe that can be drawne to nothing that is good, but by compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſtraint, it is a ſigne that they are not under the gracious government of the Lord God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If God be God over us, governing us by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his grace, wee muſt yeeld him univerſall obedience in all things. He muſt not be over us in one thing, and under us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he muſt be over us in every thing; Gods authoritie is caſt away by refuſing obedience to one Commandement, as well as by
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:113533:85"/> refuſing obedience unto all. His authoritie is ſeene in one, as well as in another. And he that breaketh one, doth in effect breake all, as <hi>James</hi> 2.11.<note place="margin">James 2.11.</note> When God cometh to rule, he cometh with power, to caſt downe every ſtrong hold, and every high thought that is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the power of Chriſt. He cometh to lay waſte the whole kingdome of ſinne, all muſt downe, not a ſtone left of that <hi>Babel.</hi> The Lord will reigne in the whole ſoule, he will have no God, no King with him. And therefore herein looke unto it, if he be God over us, he alone muſt rule over us, and no other with him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether Gods dominion hath its full extent in us; whether there be not ſome corruption which thou deſireſt to be ſpared in: Canſt thou give up thy ſelfe wholly to the power of grace, to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by it? Canſt thou part with thy <hi>Abſalom,</hi> thy beloved luſt, and be content that God ſhould ſet up his kingdome in thy whole ſoule? Then is God over thee, and thou in Covenant with him. But if thou canſt not ſubmit that the life of ſome darling luſt ſhould goe; if there be any ſinne that is dearer to thee, then to obey God; if thou haſt thy exceptions, and reſervations, and wilt not yeeld univerſall obedience, then art thou an alien from God and his Covenant; God is no God unto thee, nor art thou one of his people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Where the Lord governeth and ſetteth up his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome over the ſoule, he carries and lifts up the heart to an higher pitch, and above that which fleſh and bloud could or would attaine unto. And that both in the things themſelves, and the ends which they ayme at in them. He makes a man undertake ſuch things as his owne heart would refuſe and turne from; as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.14.<note place="margin">Ezek. 3.14.</note> he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry backward to preach to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and yet when he ſaw it was the Lords minde he ſubmitted. So <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> 15.20.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.20.</note>) <hi>enforced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> to preach the Goſpel, yet it was not a conſtrained force, but the love of Chriſt conſtrained him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> So <hi>Moſes,</hi> though at the firſt very loath to goe to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> yet when the power of grace prevailed in him, he contends with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as with his equall in the cauſe of God, and would not yeeld to the fiercenes of the King, not for an hoofe; ſo though he fled from the ſerpent at the firſt fight, yet at Gods commandement he taketh it up in his hand. This alſo wee ſee in <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was commanded to ſacrifice his owne ſonne, though he loved him, yet he loved God more, and therefore obeyed, which nature alone could never have done. In all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:113533:85"/> theſe they wrought againſt the ſtreame, doing that which fleſh and bloud could never have done. Againe, the power of Gods Grace in his government lifts up the ſoule to higher ends and aymes, then fleſh and bloud can attaine unto. The kingdome of Gods grace, is called the kingdome of heaven, his aymes and ends are on high, not earthly but heavenly, his government is an heavenly regiment, the Lord governeth the hearts of his people to the ſame end which he hath propounded to himſelfe. Gods ends and our ends meet in one, which is the glorifying of his Name. This putteth the difference between all formall hypocrites, and thoſe that are ruled by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace: hypocrites are ruled by their owne ſpirit, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ayme at higher then their owne ends, their owne honour, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, profit, &amp;c. Though their actions may be ſpirituall, yet their ends are carnall; but when God taketh the heart into his guidance, then he maketh us to ſet up him as higheſt in the throne, and all is done for his honour. It makes a man to uſe and imploy himſelfe, wiſdome, ſtrength, riches, credit, and eſteeme in the Church, and all for God, not for himſelfe; God is his laſt end in every thing, as moſt worthy to be glorified by all. Indeed a man in Covenant with God may doe many things for himſelfe, ayming at the furtherance of his owne good both ſpirituall and temporall, and alſo ayme at the good of other men, but this is not in oppoſition, but in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to God and his glory; that laſt and maine end muſt ſway all other ends. Nothing muſt be done to croſſe and hinder his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this is the government of Gods Grace. Conſider how Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit guides thy heart to thoſe things, and aymes, that fleſh and bloud cannot at all reach unto; for if thou haſt onely thine own end and ayme, then thou art thine owne, and not under the government of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Covenant of Gods grace cauſeth the peace of God to lodge in that ſoule in which it ruleth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The kingdome of God is righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Grace and peace goe hand in hand; There is a raigne and rule of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.21.</note> And ſo there is of peace, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.15.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.15.</note> As under the raigne of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> there was abundance of peace, ſo there is under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, he is the King of <hi>Salem.</hi> And the more the ſoule is ſubjected unto his government, the more peace it finds. And that may be ſeene in theſe two things.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:113533:86"/>
               <p>Firſt, In the diſpenſations and adminiſtrations of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though things goe croſſe againſt us, we meet with many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Gods providences ſeeme to croſſe his promiſes, yet there is peace to the ſoule in it; therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. laſt. <hi>In the world you ſhall have trouble, but in mee you ſhall have peace.</hi> Certain it is, that if ever our hearts be out of quiet, it is becauſe there is ſome ſedition and trayterous conſpiracy, which hath been riſing up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the kingdome of Chriſt, and this workes trouble; but where the ſoule is ſubjected to the regiment of grace, it maketh it to reſt in peace; In all wrongs, injuries, and croſſes, it knowes the Lord will right them; In all wants, it knowes that he will provide; In all kind of tryalls, that he will with the temptation give an iſſue in due time. But the heart that is unſubdued to Gods kingdome, is ready to fret againſt God, and ſit downe diſcontented when any thing croſſeth him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As it reſteth in peace under the diſpenſations of Gods providences, ſo it reſts in peace in regard of the ſpirituall enemies of our ſalvation, which fight againſt our ſoules. Whatſoever threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens our ruine, the ſoule ſhrowds it ſelfe under the wing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, and concludes with the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.22. <hi>The Lord is my Judge, he is my King, and he will ſave me.</hi> Let us examine our ſelves by theſe things, and we may ſee whether we be under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God, and ſo whether we be in Covenant with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> This may ſerve for a rule of direction, and withall for a ground of conſolation to the Lords ſervants, when they feele the ſtrength of their corruptions working in them, and their luſts prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that they make them groane, and cry with <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi> when they find themſelves foyled againe and againe, and can get no helpe againſt thoſe evills, let them fly to this promiſe of grace; let them lay this promiſe of the Covenant before them, and remember what the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>I will rule over you with a mightie hand,</hi> Ezek. 20.33.<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.33.</note> Remember the Lord of his promiſe, and claime it, that it may be made good unto thee. And ſay, Lord, thou haſt promiſed, that thou wilt rule over me; why is it then that theſe tyrants rule and raigne in my ſoule? why doth unbeliefe, pride, worldlineſſe rule? Thus make we our refuge to the throne of Grace, and then as the Lord will fulfill the other promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his Covenant, ſo he will alſo fulfill this, and will rule us by
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:113533:86"/> his Grace; he will come and plead the cauſe of his people againſt all their enemies, and ſay as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.5.<note place="margin">Iſai. 52.5.</note> 
                  <hi>What have I to doe here, that my people are taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howle, &amp;c.</hi> His meaning is as if he ſhould ſay, What doe you meane, <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Aſhur,</hi> to trouble my people, that you put me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to trouble in reſcuing them? let them alone, or elſe I will make you feele my power, &amp;c. So it is in the enemies of our ſoules, when we are forced to howle unto God, by reaſon of the bondage of our corruptions, he will ſet us free, he himſelfe will be a God over us, to rule us by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>This being one of the bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace, to have <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> God to be Lord over us, let us then all be admoniſhed to give up our ſelves to the regiment of his grace, as the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.5.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.5.</note> 
                  <hi>They gave themſelves to the Lord.</hi> The Lord gives himſelfe to us, good reaſon that we ſhould give up our ſelves to him. O happy day when the ſoule is perſwaded to give up it ſelfe into ſuch an hand! Thinke it enough that yee have ſpent the time paſt in the ſervice of ſinne and Satan, thoſe cruell Lords which you have obeyed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.3.</note> and now for time to come give up your ſoules to him, that is ready with ſtretched out armes to receive thoſe that come to him.

               </p>
               <p>And for a motive, conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That though you may ſtand out againſt the government and authoritie of Gods grace, yet you cannot reſiſt the government of his power, but there the Lord will be above you, as he was above <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> Exod. 18.11.<note place="margin">Exod. 18.11.</note> He thought to have been above God, and to have kept the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in bondage, but wherein they dealt proudly he was above them; If thou wilt not be ſubject to his grace, yet thou ſhalt be ſubject to his power, which no creature can reſiſt, therefore all the while that thou ſtandeſt out againſt the government of Gods grace, thou doſt but ſpurne againſt the prick which is hard to doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Looke at this as one of the great bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to be under the Lords government and guidance; Is it not better to be under the government of the bleſſed, holy, gracious, and mercifull God, then under the uncleane, wicked and cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Satan the Devill? But it may be ſome will ſay, they will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:113533:87"/> neither, but that cannot be, there are no more ſpirituall regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world; he that is not ſubject to the government of Gods grace, is a ſubject to the Devill; What a glorious priviledge is this, that a Chriſtian may ſay, that no creature, nor Angel, nor Devill, nor ſin, hath power over him, but God alone? This is even to be a King upon earth, Let every ſoule therefore be exhorted to come under this government, and let us not doe as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.7.</note> who caſt off God from being their King. Caſt not off the Lord, leſt he caſt off you, and you become a reprobate people, but if you will be your owne men, you will not have God to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, if it ſeeme evill unto you to ſerve the Lord, then chooſe you whom you will ſerve, goe every one and ſerve his own Idolls, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.39.<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.39.</note> and walke after your own counſell, but withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what <hi>Samuel</hi> told the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that if they would have a King, they ſhould at laſt cry out for the King that they had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; ſo you, that will not have God to rule over you, but your own luſts, you will cry out one day and howle for the King that you have choſen, and you ſhall then know the difference between the ſervice of the Lord, and of the God whom you have obeyed. Come in therefore and ſeeke the Lord, and give up your ſelves to be his people, that he may raigne over you; come within the kingdome of his grace here, and he will prepare a kingdome of glory for you hereafter. Thus much of the firſt and greateſt bleſſing of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, <hi>I will be your God.</hi>

                  <hi>I will forgive their iniquitie, and remember their ſin no more.</hi> By this promiſe the Lord takes away that great ſcruple and feare that might fill the hearts of his people, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the greatneſſe of their ſinnes would exclude them from ever having benefit by the former promiſe; for if the ſoule hearing ſuch a promiſe revealed, <hi>I will be your God,</hi> ſhould now reply and ſay, Yea he will be the God of the juſt, as of <hi>Abraham</hi> and ſuch as have not ſinned againſt him, but I have ſinned, and my tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are exceeding many, and they ſtand up as a partition wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and me, how can he then be a God to me, or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himſelfe and his goodneſſe unto me ſo vile and ſinfull? Now the Lord in this promiſe taketh away this objection, and ſaith, I
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:113533:87"/> know you have ſinned, I have ſeene your rebellions againſt mee, yet this ſhall not hinder, but yet I will be your God, and what ever ſinnes you have committed, I will doe them away, and put them out of my ſight, and will be your God: and thus the Lord ſeemes to anſwer his people, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.4.9. compared together. The Lord having promiſed deliverance to his people, they might ſay, Wee are unworthy; I know it, ſaith the Lord, that thou art obſtinate, and yet verſe ninth, <hi>For my Names ſake I will deferre my anger, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, In regard of thy ſelfe, and thy own ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thou deſerveſt to be cut off, and left in thy miſery, yet for my praiſe I will doe thee good. The ſinnes therefore of Gods people ſhall not breake off their intereſt in God, they may ſerve to magnifie the grace of God toward them, but ſhall not leſſen nor hinder it. Well therefore may this promiſe be reckoned amongſt the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant of Grace, and be ſet in the next place to the former promiſe, <hi>I will be your God.</hi> This promiſe of pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinne, is one of the great bleſſings of the Covenant of grace, as ſounding forth nothing but <hi>Grace and bleſſing; Grace from God,</hi> and <hi>bleſſing to us;</hi> Grace from God, according to that, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7.<note place="margin">Exod. 34.6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord gracious and mercifull, pardoning ſin, forgiving ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and tranſgreſſion, &amp;c.</hi> So it alſo imports kindnes and bleſſing to us, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.1.</note> Here is Grace, yea rich Grace in this promiſe of forgiveneſſe of ſin, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.7.</note> It is grace, becauſe nothing but grace and mercy can forgive. God is juſt, but it is not juſtice that doth pardon ſin; Juſtice taketh vengeance for ſin, it will not ſpare our miſdeeds; but grace taketh pitie and forgiveth. Againe, it is grace, becauſe we have nothing to ſatisfie withall for the evills which wee have done, and therefore there is the more grace to us in pardoning. Againe, there is grace in it, becauſe God hath power in his hand to take vengeance; He doth not paſſe by ſin, as men doe offences, when they diſſemble forgivenes, becauſe they cannot tell how to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and yet carry rancor and malice in their hearts, but God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives, though he hath power to deſtroy and take vengeance, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35.<note place="margin">Deut. 32.35.</note> He is able to deſtroy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> and yet chooſeth to forgive. Hence <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6.<note place="margin">Exod. 34.6.</note> the Lord joyns theſe together, <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> &amp;c. This ſhews him to be gracious, that he is ſtrong and yet pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; There is infinite grace ſhines forth in forgiving the ſinnes of men; And this will appeare if wee conſider theſe things.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:113533:88"/>
               <p>Firſt, conſider the nature of ſin, which is a kind of wrong do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, there is injurious provocation in it, provoking the jealouſie of the mighty God. As if a wiſe ſhould wrong her husband by forſaking him, and joyning her ſelf to another man, how could ſuch a wrong be recompenced? Yet ſuch wrong we doe unto God: for in every ſin wee commit, there is a turning unto the creature, and forſaking the Creator. Here is grace therefore in forgiving ſuch injuries, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. <hi>If a man put away his wife, and ſhe become another mans, will he return to her again? &amp;c. But thou haſt plaid the harlot with many lovers, yet return unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Wherein doth grace and kindneſſe appeare more, then in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſing by wrongs? It is an eaſier thing to ſhew many courteſies and benefits to one that never wronged us, then to forgive one petry injury: yet here is the grace of God unto us, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider againſt whom our ſins have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that will ſet forth grace more: They are not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt man alone, but againſt the Lord. Now a Prince will ſometime forgive a treſpaſſe againſt a common ordinary ſubject, but that which is againſt their own perſon they ſeldome ſpare. Our ſins are againſt God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.25.</note> and yet he paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th by ſuch tranſgreſſions. This is abundant grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider to whom ſin is forgiven, and to whom it is not forgiven: it is forgiven to us that were enemies, but not to his own deare Sonne when hee came to be a mediator between God and us. Hee could not have one ſinne forgiven him, God would not ſpare him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> but took the full ſatisfaction of ſin from him; but yet hee ſpareth us that were enemies. Here is grace indeed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, conſider the quality of the Lords forgiveneſſe both in the freeneſſe and fulneſſe of it: he forgiveth freely, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, &amp;c.</hi> Hence ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.9, 11.<note place="margin">Iſai 48.9.11.</note> 
                  <hi>For my Names ſake will I deferre my anger, &amp;c. For my own ſake will I doe it: for how ſhould my Name bee polluted? and I will not give my glory to another.</hi> I will doe it freely: for if I ſhould take any ſatisfaction from thee, I ſhould pollute my Name, and darken the glory of my grace, and give it to thee, that thou wouldeſt think that thou wert pardoned for thy ſacrifices and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:113533:88"/> thy goodneſſe. The ſin that God pardoneth, he doth it freely for his praiſe ſake. Papiſts may talk of their ſatisfaction to God for their ſinnes, but theſe are but the words of men, and they cloud over the glory of Gods grace, and take the glory of God to themſelves. But upon ſuch termes God will never forgive. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men though one have offended another, yet the conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former or after courteſie may deſerve to have ſuch an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence paſſed by: but it is not ſo with God. Nothing that we can doe, can plead any ſuch worth; his forgiveneſſe is free, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.25, 26.<note place="margin">Iſaiah 43.25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake; Put me in remembrance,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>let us plead together:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we are ready to think, that it is not onely for his own ſake, but alſo for our ſakes, for ſomething which we have done, that hee forgives our ſins. The Lord taketh this away, and ſaith, Come, and remember me now, and tell me what it is that I ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee for, the Lord looketh at nothing in that ſoule which hee pardoneth, but onely at his own praiſe: he doth it freely. Again, as God doth it freely, ſo he doth it fully: his forgiveneſſe is a full forgiveneſſe; hee putteth away all our ſinnes, old, new, great, ſmall, guilt and puniſhment, ſo that the ſinnes of Gods people are before God as though they had never been committed, never to be required at their hand. The expreſſions the Scripture uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> but, that though God doe ſee ſinne in them by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:113533:89"/> the eye of his knowledge, yet he doth not ſee them by the eye of his judgement, to lay them to their charge. Nay, the Lord will ſo farre put away the ſinnes of his people, that if hee ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come and make inquiſition for ſinne in them, yet there ſhall not be one found, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20.<note place="margin">Jer. 50.20.</note> they are paſt and gone as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Noah,</hi> never to return again. If wee conſider all theſe, the provocation that is in ſinne, and how many they are, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they are committed, to whom they are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and how freely and fully they are pardoned, we muſt needs ſay, Here is grace, yea riches of grace in the forgiveneſſe of ſin: It is therefore a bleſſing of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as there is grace ſhewn from God in the pardon of ſinne, ſo infinite benefit and bleſſing commeth to us thereby, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquity is forgiven, &amp;c.</hi> This is not a promiſe of no value, but is one of the moſt great and pretious promiſes of the Covenant, of more worth then thouſands of gold and ſilver. How great a benefit this is, will appeare, if we conſider how great an evill ſinne is which by forgiveneſſe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. The greatneſſe of the one will ſet forth the greatneſſe of the other. Now ſin is the greateſt evill in the world, and that both in it ſelfe, and to us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in it ſelfe it is the greateſt, whether we conſider it ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in its own nature and being; or cauſally, making evill the ſubject that it dwels in. In the former reſpect it is the greateſt evill, becauſe it is contrary to the greateſt good. God is good, he is goodneſſe it ſelfe, his will alſo is holy, juſt, and good. Now nothing is ſo contrary to God, and to the goodneſſe of his holy will, as ſin is: this croſſeth the holineſſe of his will. And as for the other, if we conſider fin cauſally, what is it which makes the creature evill (as we read of evill Angels, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.49.<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.49.</note> and of evill men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.13.</note>) Whence is it that they are become evill? It is onely by ſinne, they were created good, but ſin hath corrupted them and made them evill. And that which makes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things evill, muſt needs of it ſelfe be much more evill. Take away the ſin from Devils, and they are good; they are evill onely by ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, but that which more neerly concerns the point in hand, is to conſider, how ſin is the greateſt evill unto us, and that appears,</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:113533:89"/>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is ſin, and ſin onely, which excludes us from God, and makes a ſeparation between God and us. Poverty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſickneſſe, &amp;c. theſe are evils, but they are not ſuch evils as are able to ſeparate us from God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> God was with <hi>Joſeph</hi> in priſon, with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the dungeon, with thoſe that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred up and down in wilderneſſes in ſheep-skins, and goat-skins,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.37, 38.</note> being afflicted, deſtitute, and tormented. But ſin is as a partition-wall betwixt God and us, it ſeparates betwixt us and our God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.1, 2.<note place="margin">Iſai. 59.1, 2.</note> Sin breeds an alienation and ſtrangeneſſe betwixt us, ſo as till ſin be taken away, there can be no communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and us. But now by the forgiveneſſe of ſin, this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-wall is pulled down, ſo as we have free acceſſe unto God, and may come into his preſence, and behold his face, and ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, being accepted in his beloved. Now by the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſin we return again unto our former eſtate in which wee ſtood before our fall, before that ſin had broken us off from God. Now as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>We have fellowſhip with the Father, and with his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In our fall ſin brake off our communion with God, but by the forgiveneſſe of ſin wee have liberty to recover this our communion with him again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſin is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hinders all other good things from us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25.<note place="margin">Jer. 5.25.</note> If we want any thing that is good for us, thank our ſin for it: God is good, and ready to doe good, free to communicate his goodneſſe to all his creatures; why then are good things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from us? It is our ſin which intercepts them, and cuts us ſhort. But now when ſin is done away by forgiveneſſe, then is the former hinderance removed: this doth as it were turn the cock which ſtops the courſe of the bleſſing from comming unto us, and now we recover an intereſt in all the good things of the world, ſo as all things are ours when ſinne is not ours, but is taken away from us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſin which brings all ſorrowes and miſeries upon us, this is that which brings ſword, famine, peſtilence, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all ſuch outward calamities, ſin i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he true cauſe of all theſe. Theſe ſpring not out of the duſt, nor come by chance, but are the fruit which growes upon the forbidden tree of ſin: but let ſin once be forgiven, then are theſe things which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves evill, turned unto good unto us: Affliction is good when
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:113533:90"/> the ſin which cauſeth it is gone and done away; one that hath his ſin forgiven, may rejoyce in affliction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Romans 5.</note> yea, hee may be exceeding joyous in all tribulations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.4.</note> When ſin, which is the ſting of every croſſe, is removed, is pulled out, then may we take up that croſſe which before we fled from as from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and put it in our boſome, and not be hurt by it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it turns good things into evill unto us: ſometimes God gives good things even to wicked and evill men, making his Sunne to ſhine, and rain to fall upon the wicked and unjuſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45.<note place="margin">Matth 5.45.</note> But ſo long as ſinne is unpardoned, though the things be good in themſelves, yet they are not good unto them; ſin corrupts the good things they enjoy, it turns bleſſings into curſes, as the Lord ſaith in <hi>Malachi</hi> 2.2.<note place="margin">Malachi 2.2.</note>

               <p>Fifthly, what an evill ſin is, and what a benefit forgiveneſſe is, we may conceive, if we doe but look on ſuch men as have felt the ſting of ſin in their own conſciences, and have felt the burthen of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, it is the purpoſe which he hath everlaſtingly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed within himſelfe, to make his grace glorious in thoſe whom he hath by covenant given unto Chriſt to be ſaved by him; he <hi>will have</hi> the praiſe of <hi>the glory</hi> of his grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1 6.</note> Hee will not loſe this glory, he will be admired in the Saints, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10.<note place="margin">2 Theſſ 1.10.</note> Hee will make the world to wonder, when it ſhall bee known what ſin hath been committed by them, and pardoned by him. Gods people are called <hi>veſſels of mercy, Rom.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> As thoſe therefore which are veſſels of wrath, ſhall be full of the wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Almighty, to make his wrath known in them: ſo the veſſels of mercy ſhall be filled with mercy, filled up to the brim; God will have no empty veſſels, all ſhall be full, one ſort filled with wrath, the other with mercy.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:113533:91"/>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord hath received a ſatisfaction to his Juſtice in Chriſt; what ever Juſtice could require at our hand, Chriſt hath ſatisfied for us to the utmoſt farthing. So that now Juſtice cannot complaine, though that ſin be forgiven unto us, becauſe it was fully puniſhed in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If the Lord ſhould not forgive the ſinnes of his people which believe on Chriſt, Chriſt his ſufferings ſhould be in vaine. To what end was it for him to ſuffer, the juſt for the unjuſt? Why was the chaſtiſement of our peace laid upon him, if wee ſhould alſo ſuffer for our owne ſinnes? God would never have laid our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon him, but that he intended to forgive them unto us.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is no other way to have ſinne done away, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to get free from ſin, but by forgivenes. Either God muſt forgive ſin, or all the world muſt be condemned, and lie under his curſe for ever. But there are a remnant, that God will ſave from periſhing in the condemnation of the world, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Lord hath not onely promiſed forgivenes, and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it with his mouth, but his act and deed gives us aſſurance that he will faithfully performe unto us that which he hath promiſed, his dealing with us doth evidently declare his gracious inclination towards us, and his readineſſe to forgive.</p>
               <p>Firſt, His great patience in waiting for our repentance and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, he waits for this very end, that he might be gracious, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.18.<note place="margin">Iſai. 30.18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, His proclaiming of his Name, as he doth in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>The Lord, the Lord, gracious, mercifull, forgiving iniquities;</hi> why doth the Lord thus proclaime his Name, and tell us openly that he is a <hi>God forgiving iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. but that we might take notice of his graciouſneſſe towards us, and might be encouraged to looke unto him for forgiveneſſe? Even as Kings proclaime their pardon, that they might be acknowledged to be gracious Lords.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His gracious invitation alſo aſſures us that he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; <hi>Come unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. If ſin burthen you, I will eaſe you. Yea he entreats us to accept of reconciliation, and to be reconciled unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider his commanding of us to forgive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he commands other men to forgive us, which is an argument that himſelfe will forgive. For, firſt, herein he ſhewes his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:113533:91"/> us, that he would not have the hatred of any creature to lye againſt us, no not ſo much as the diſpleaſure of a weake man; but would have us to enjoy their love; how much leſſe then will he let his owne wrath lye upon us, which is infinitely more heavie then the diſpleaſure of all the creatures in the whole world? and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If he would have <hi>us</hi> to forgive one another, which have ſo littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> love and compaſſion in us, how much more will <hi>he</hi> forgive us, his compaſſion being ſo tender and pitifull towards the worke of his own hands? Theſe acts of his goodneſſe doe confirme this unto us, that he is a gracious God ready to forgive.</p>
               <p>This lets us ſee the onely way to get free from the guilt of our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> ſinne, which lyes upon us; here is the way, and there is no other, but to fly to grace and mercy to obtain free forgivenes. The wicked hypocrite thinkes to eſcape, by denying his ſin, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> or by hiding it from the eyes of the Almightie, as they doe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.7.<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.7.</note> Others thinke that God cannot know them, as <hi>Job</hi> 22.13, 14.<note place="margin">Job 22.13, 14.</note> or that he will not regard them, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.7. But marke what the Lord himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.3.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>I know Ephraim, and Iſrael is not hid from me.</hi> And in <hi>Amos</hi> 5.12.<note place="margin">Amos 5.12.</note>

                  <hi>I remember all their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,</hi> ſaith the Lord; yea he hath Our ſinnes laid up as amongſt his treaſures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34.<note place="margin">Deut. 32.34.</note> and ſealed up as in a bag, <hi>Job</hi> 14.17.<note place="margin">Job 14.17.</note> to bring them forth againſt ſuch Atheiſticall hypocrites, in the day of his viſitation. Others thinke to make amends for their ſinnes, that they will appeaſe God with thouſands of Rammes, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand rivers of oyle, as <hi>Micah</hi> 6.7. but the Lord will be appeaſed by none of theſe. Our onely way is to fly to grace, and to free forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all other meanes, whether pardons from men, or ſatisfactions from our ſelves, will not free us from the guilt of the leaſt ſin, the taking away of our ſinnes muſt either be by free forgiveneſſe, or they muſt lye upon us for ever.</p>
               <p>Is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes one of the bleſſings of the Covenant? then <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> ſurely it reacheth no further, nor to no more then to ſuch as doe give up themſelves to God, to walke in Covenant with him; ſuch therefore as walke contrary to the Covenant which is between God and his people, ſuch as will be bound in no bonds, but caſt away all bonds from them, and will walke at libertie, and will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, let ſuch know, that the <hi>bond of the Covenant</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

When God drawes his people into the bond of his Covenant, then he is about the forgiving them their ſinnes. Conſider that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27.<note place="margin">Rom 11.26, 27.</note> when God doth take away the ſin of a people, then doth he alſo make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, and takes away ungodlineſſe from them.

This benefit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes, is proper onely unto thoſe that are a people in Covenant with God, and doe by Covenant bind themſelves unto him, to walke before him as becoming his people.</p>

I will ſanctifie you to be an holy and pretious people to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>This renovation and ſanctification of our nature, ſtands firſt in cleanſing away our ſinfull corruption, and then in an infuſion and filling of us with the holy graces of the Spirit. As a veſſell which wee intend for any honourable uſe, firſt wee ſcoure and rinſe out the filth that is in it, and then we ſweeten it with other things, and ſo make it fit for ſervice and uſe. Satan had defiled us with his loathſome filthineſſe, but ſo many as the Lord ſets apart unto himſelfe, to be veſſels of honour in his houſe, thoſe hee clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit, and ſeaſoneth them with all the ſweet and gracious gifts of his Spirit.

               <p>And we are ſaid to be created new in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. becauſe as in our firſt creation we were then created holy and righteous after the Image of God: ſo now we are renewed unto the ſame image again. The Lord doth with us as the Potter doth with his veſſell, when the firſt faſhioning of it is broken, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns and makes it another veſſell, as ſeems good in his eyes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.3. By this work of renovation and changing our natures, there is a new diſpoſition wrought in us, clean contrary to that which was before. Whereas before, the wiſdome of the fleſh, and our corrupt will was quite contrary, and even enmity againſt the Law of God, and would by no meanes bee brought into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> yet now we are made to love the Law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Commandements of it in our inward man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> The law is not now any more a law without us, to urge and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force us, but it is a law within us; it is written not in Tables of ſtone, but in the heart, according to that promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.<note place="margin">Jeremy 31.</note>

               <p>Firſt, becauſe hee hath for this end choſen them, that they might be holy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.</note> and therefore he will bring them to that eſtate of holineſſe, to which hee hath choſen them. What he hath choſen us to, he will bring us to, Gods purpoſes are not in vain, hee will perform to us all the good hee hath intended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath purchaſed the ſpirit of grace for us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19.<note place="margin">John 17.19.</note> 
                  <hi>For their ſakes</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſanctifie I my ſelfe</hi> (offering up himſelfe as a conſecrate offering unto God) <hi>that they may bee ſanctified by the truth.</hi> It was for our ſanctification that he offered up himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee hath filled himſelfe with all grace for that ſame end, that we might bee filled by that abundance of grace which is in him. <hi>Pſal,</hi> 68.18.<note place="margin">Pſalm 68.18.</note> he received gifts <hi>for men,</hi> not to keep them to himſelfe alone, but to communicate unto us, that out of his fulneſſe wee might all receive grace for grace, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. And therefore Chriſt is ſaid to bee not onely righteouſneſſe unto us, but ſanctification, becauſe he hath filled himſelfe to the end that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:113533:96"/> he might alſo fill us with his own ſanctity and holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt hath prayed for our ſanctification, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. And wee know that hee was heard alwayes, no prayer of his ever returned empty, but came back with a full bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fifthly, Gods covenant is to give us all things that pertain to life and godlineſſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, the Lord is an holy God, and therefore will have thoſe that are in covenant with him, to bee an holy people, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. It would be a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore he will have his covenanted people to be holy, that he may communicate himſelf unto them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, when the Lord gives himſelf unto a people to be a God unto them, he gives himſelfe wholly unto them, keeping back nothing from them which might make them an happy and bleſſed people. And therefore as he doth communicate himſelfe to them in his mercy and grace, to pardon their ſin, ſo he doth alſo in his purity and holineſſe to ſanctifie them, and to cleanſe them from their ſin.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, God will be glorified in all his people, whom he takes neer unto himſelfe, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3.<note place="margin">Levit. 10.3.</note> and in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.21.<note place="margin">Iſaiah 43.21.</note> 
                  <hi>This people have I formed for my ſelfe, they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe.</hi> But God could have no glory from us in this world, if he ſhould not ſanctifie us. Herein is he glorified, when wee bring forth much good fruit, <hi>John</hi> 15.<note place="margin">John 15.</note> and ſhine forth in good works, <hi>Matth</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> and ſhew forth the vertues of him that hath called us, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. In theſe things God is glorified by us; but this glory wee can never bring to God, till he have ſent down his Spirit of glory and grace upon us. Now leſt this bleſſing of ſanctification ſhould ſeem too little to be reckoned among the great bleſſings of the covenant, let us therfore conſider how great a priviledge this is, to be renewed &amp; ſanctified by the grace of Gods holy Spirit. This is intended to us
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:113533:96"/> as a bleſſing, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.1, 2, 3.<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.1, 2, 3</note> The Lord maketh many ſweet promiſes to his Iſrael; and in <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>powre my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thy buds.</hi> When God powres on any his Spirit, then hee would have us to know, that he powres on them a rich bleſſing. My <hi>Spirit</hi> and my <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> ſaith God. As it is a mans curſe to bee left under the power &amp; dominion of ſin: ſo <hi>contrà,</hi> it is a bleſſing to be ſet free from ſin, and to be renewed unto holines. Therefore it is that when Chriſt converts us from our ſins, he is ſaid to bleſſe us in converting us from our iniquities, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 3. ult.</note> It is a bleſsing indeed.

               <p>For firſt, by being ſanctified in our ſelves, wee come to have a ſanctified uſe of all other bleſſings which we enjoy. To the pure all things are pure, but to the impure all things are impure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. <hi>end.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Titus 1. end</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, holineſſe is the Image of the bleſſed God, it conforms unto him, makes us like unto him. This is our excellency and our glory in the eyes of Angels and Men, in nothing are wee ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as in holineſſe; this is a Crown and Diadem upon our head: and therefore <hi>David</hi> calls the Saints by the name of <hi>excellent ones, Pſal.</hi> 16.3.<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> Sanctity makes a man to excell himſelfe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres him above the common condition of men.

God loved us before with a love of benevolence and good will; but now he loves us with a love of complacency, taking pleaſure in his people, as the Prophet ſpeaks <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.11.149.4.<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.11, 149.4.</note>

               <p>Fifthly, By being ſanctified, wee have peace increaſed in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.

While ſin raignes, there is no peace, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the Conſcience perplexed by it, but the affections of the ſoule are ſet at variance one againſt another. Pride would have one thing, and covetouſneſſe would have another; Hypocriſie and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are divided one againſt another; Like ſo many contrary winds which lie upon the face of the deep, and daſh the waves one againſt another. Thus a multitude of contrary paſſions and luſts, diſtract and divide the ſoule aſunder, ſo that while ſin rules in us, there is no peace. But when grace beginnes to have its kingdome ſet up in us, it then brings with it a bleſſed peace. Holineſſe and peace goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; All the faculties of the ſoule being ſanctified by grace, they do now ayme at one end, which is the doing of Gods will, and this unitie makes peace.</p>

In a word, how great a bleſſing this is, we may conceive by the lamentable complaint of the Apoſtle, groaning under the bondage of his corruption,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſhall deliver me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) from this body of death?</hi> He knew himſelfe to be already delivered from the law of death, and the power of it, ſo that death could not hurt him, and yet <hi>Paul</hi> would have another deliverance ſtill; There was yet one thing which troubled him, the body of death, the ſin which hangeth ſo faſt on; the remnant of corruption which like fetters hampered him, that he could not ſo perfectly fulfill the will of God. This plague of the heart within, <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to be healed of, who (ſaith he) will helpe me, who will deliver me from this miſery, and ſet me free out of this bondage of corruption? <hi>Paul</hi> was many a time in bonds, in perſecution, and manifold ſufferings for Chriſts ſake, but never doe we heare him complaine ſo of theſe; he never ſaid, Who will deliver me and ſet me free out of this priſon, out of theſe bonds, out of theſe pinching wants, &amp;c. But that which moſt troubled him, was his ſinful corruption of nature within; This is the plague which above all other he deſires to be delivered from. And ſurely ſuch is the diſpoſition of all thoſe, whoſe hearts God hath effectually tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with his ſpirit of grace, that if they had the kingdomes of the world for their own, they could be content, to forgoe all, ſo they might be rid of ſin, and have their ſanctification perfected in them.</p>
               <p>Now as we have ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ne that this ſanctification is a ſingular benefit and bleſſing unto us; ſo let us conſider alſo how it ſprings forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us out of the ſame fountain of grace, as did the former benefit of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:113533:99"/> forgiveneſſe of ſins. Theſe two ſtreames iſſue out of the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of grace. When God ſanctifies us, adding this benefit to the former, we may then ſay, Grace, grace; wee doe herein receive a double grace; Grace in forgiving, grace in ſanctifying of us; here is grace upon grace. It is a bleſſing of rich grace. And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if we conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, How impiouſly and wickedly we have forſaken our firſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bleſſed eſtate, in which the Lord had created us. <hi>God made man righteous,</hi> Eccleſ. 10. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. ult.</note> but he would be finding out many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of his own, and if he could not invent them in the ſhop of his own braine, then he would take them out of Satans forge, by thoſe inventions thinking to make himſelfe more excellent then God had made him; and ſo did wilfully caſt away that glory of grace, with which he was clothed, defaced the Image of God which was ſtampt upon him, bringing upon himſelfe a ſinfull and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nakedneſſe, to the contempt of his perſon before all creatures; caſt off his God that had formed him, ſetting light by the God of his ſalvation, chuſing to obey the curſed ſuggeſtion of Satan, Gods enemy, rather then to retaine his communion with God. This did he, and we in him, and now the Lord might have ſaid unto us all, <hi>Let him that is filthy, be filthy ſtill.</hi> Seeing you have thus defiled your ſelves, you ſhall never be cleanſed, untill I have made my wrath to fall upon you, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. It is wonderfull grace, if ever the Lord will returne to ſuch, to renew us and ſanctifie us by his grace; Our ſin was like the ſin of Angels, who kept not their firſt eſtate, no more did we, wee ſinned as they did, but we are ſanctified, and not they, here is grace towards us, not towards them. They are ſuffered ſtill to perſiſt in their malicious wickedneſſe, but we are renewed againe according to the Image of him that created us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the loathſomenes of the ſin and corruption which we have brought upon our ſelves, and doth now lie upon us; <hi>A wicked man is loathſome</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) Pro.</hi> 13.5.<note place="margin">Prov. 13.5.</note> So loathſome is the ſin that is in us, that we are made even to loath our ſelves, and to count our ſelves more filthy then the dung of the earth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. When the Lord formed man in the beginning, it was not ſilver or gold, or any ſuch precious matter, out of which he faſhioned him, but it was out of the vileſt of the Elements, out of the earth, the dregs &amp; ſetlings of all creatures. The matter out of which man was
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:113533:99"/> then made, was but vile and baſe. Wonder it was that God would ſet the gracious Image of his holines upon ſo contemptible a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But though it was then but vile, yet it was (as I may ſo ſpeake) innocent, harmles. The pollution of ſinne had not as yet defiled it, there was nothing in it as yet, which ſhould make the holy God to loath the creature which he had made; ſinne had not as yet ſtained the earth with its filthines. But now by ſin man is become abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his uncleanneſſe is as the filthines of the menſtruous; the filthy leproſie of ſin is not in his forehead alone, but is ſpread all over him; ſo that the Lord might ſay unto him, Depart, depart yee polluted, ſtand apart, the pure eyes of my holines cannot endure to behold ſuch loathſome filthines. But now behold and wonder, even the God ſo glorious in holines, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. even he ſeeing us lye polluted in our bloud, he doth not paſſe by on the other ſide, but he takes pitie on us, and takes us and waſheth us with water; he waſheth us from our bloud, and anoynteth us with oyle, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6.9. yea and cloaths us againe with white linnen of ſanctity and holines, adornes us with ornaments of grace, which are as jewels of ſilver and jewels of gold, &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. and makes us beautifull by his owne beauty which he puts upon us. And is not this grace? Had wee ſeene our bleſſed Saviour riſe up from the table to waſh the foule feet of his ſervants, we would have wondred. How much more wonderfull is this, that he ſhould take us filthy lepers, and waſh us in the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> untill we be wholly cleane? Conſider that place in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9. how the Lord himſelfe amplifies this grace towards us in waſhing us from our polluted bloud. No leſſe then three times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Lord there mention this, <hi>When I ſaw thee polluted in thy bloud;</hi> (ſaith the Lord) and againe, <hi>When thou waſt in thy bloud;</hi> and a third time, <hi>Even when thou waſt in thy bloud, then I took thee and waſhed thee, and ſaid unto thee, Thou ſhalt live.</hi> Why doth the Lord ſo ingeminate, ſo double and treble this, <hi>When thou waſt in thy bloud?</hi> but onely that we might the more obſerve his abundant grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in purifying ſuch loathſome uncleane ones as wee are. Doubtles <hi>David</hi> when he had defiled himſelfe by that great and foule ſin, he counted it mercy and rich grace to have a cleane heart renewed in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.<note place="margin">Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider how unable we are to cleanſe and purifie our ſelves; we are like little babes, who can defile themſelves, but would
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:113533:100"/> lie in their uncleannes for ever, ſhould not the nurſe waſh &amp; cleanſe them; we once ſtript our ſelves of the garments of grace, but now we know not how to put them on any more; we were <hi>men,</hi> at that time, when (in <hi>Adam</hi>) wee laid them by and put them off: But now like little <hi>children</hi> we ſhould ſtarve with cold and nakedneſſe, ſhould not the Lord pitie us, and put theſe garments of grace upon us. <hi>We are,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>of no ſtrength,</hi> Rom. 5.6.<note place="margin">Rom 5.6.</note> not able to thinke a good thought,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> nor to will one good deſire; but it is God that worketh in us both will and deed of his good pleaſure of grace towards us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> It is not in our willing or running, but in God ſhewing mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.16.</note> And it is not unworthy our obſerving, how in <hi>ver.</hi> 18. he oppoſeth mercy to hardening, <hi>(He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth)</hi> to teach us to look at it as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall mercy, when he is pleaſed to take away the hard &amp; ſtony heart from us, and give us an heart of fleſh, ſoft and pliable to his will.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As we could not renew &amp; ſanctifie our ſelves, ſo neither could any other help us, and reſtore us againe to the holines we had loſt; In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5.<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.5.</note> the Lord tells his people there, how little helpe they had from any other, when they lay in their miſery, there was no eye that pitied them, to doe any thing to them, or to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them. The Prieſt and the Levite, they come and look on, but they paſſe by on the other ſide, there is nothing done to heale the wound which Satan by ſin had given to our ſoules, but they are let alone to putrifie and corrupt the whole man more and more, ſo as from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the foot, there is nothing but ſores, and ſwelling, and wounds full of corruption, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. But when the Lord ſaw that there was none to helpe, then he himſelfe (like the good <hi>Samaritan</hi>) comes &amp; waſheth our wounds, powring in wine and oyle, to cleanſe and to heale us. Such was our pollution, ſo deeply ſet, that all the water of the Sea, all the bloud of bulls and goats, could not cleanſe us; yea though we ſhould waſh in <hi>Nitre</hi> and take us much ſope, yet our iniquity would ſtill ſtand undone away before the face of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.22. Onely that ſpirit of life, that ſpirit of holines, that ſpirit of power which is in Chriſt Jeſus, that ſpirit being ſhed down upon us, that cleanſeth us, waſheth us, ſanctifies us; without this, all helps under heaven had been in vaine, without this ſpirit, neither Word, Sacrament, Commandements, promiſes, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trained up in the Communion of the Church, and Chriſtian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:113533:100"/> neither any nor all theſe could availe to renew us to the grace from which we are fallen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, Let me adde this one thing more, If we ſhould look at God himſelfe onely as juſt, and not as gracious, we could never have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to have obtained this bleſſing from him. Juſtice could have ſaid no other unto us, then as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.39. Seeing you would not obey me, goe therefore &amp; ſerve every man his Idoll, ſerve your ſin. When we had turned the glory of God into a lye, and had worſhipped the creature above the Creator, (who is bleſſed for ever) Juſtice would then have given us up unto vile affections, and to our owne hearts luſts, and to a reprobate mind, to doe the things that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, ſo receiving in our ſelves ſuch a recompence of our errour as was meet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> This would have been the reward of Juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us for our ſin; But here Grace comes in and powres downe upon us a ſpirit of grace and of ſanctification, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> to waſh us from our uncleannes, that we might be an holy people unto God. And hence it is that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. when the Apoſtle prayes for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of our ſanctification in us, he looks at God as a God of all Grace; <hi>The God of all Grace</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which hath called us unto his eternall glory by Jeſus Chriſt, confirme, ſtrengthen, and ſtabliſh you, &amp;c.</hi> As thereby ſhewing from what fountain the benefit of ſanctification comes, namely, from Grace, from the God of all grace. He is a God of all grace towards us in ſanctifying of us.</p>
               <p>This may helpe to ſettle us and confirme us in the truth, namely, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> that ſeeing Sanctification is a bleſſing of the Covenant of grace, even as forgivenes is, therefore it is a warrantable and ſafe way for a man by and from his ſanctification to take an evidence of his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of his eſtate in Grace before God. Forgivenes of ſinnes, and ſanctification, are both of them bleſſings of the ſame Covenant: As is the one, ſo is the other; the one is of grace, ſo is the other of grace alſo. Here therefore to take an evidence of our juſtification (ſtanding in the forgivenes of our ſinnes) from our ſanctification, is not a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide from the Covenant of grace, to a Covenant of workes, but it is to prove one benefit of the Covenant of Grace, by another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the ſame Covenant. This argument is unanſwerable. I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus, If juſtification and ſanctification be both of them b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:113533:101"/> benefits of the Covenant of Grace. <hi>Ergo.</hi> If ſo be the forgivenes of our ſinnes were promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, and Sanctification were a bleſſing of the Covenant of workes, then might it well be ſaid, that to evidence one by the other, were a turning aſide from the Covenant of grace to that other of workes; But when they are both promiſed, both communicated to us by the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there is no colour to charge this way of evidencing our eſtate, with turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide to another Covenant.</p>

               <p n="1">1. This opinion imports thus much, That one under the covenant of workes, may performe acts that are holy, which is falſe; he may indeed doe ſuch things as are materially holy, as being commanded of God, whoſe word and Covenant doth ſanctifie them, &amp; make the things holy in themſelves, but they are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally holy, but, (coming from their impure hearts) thereby they are polluted and defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. And therefore can have no ſuch power to worke ſanctitie in the ſubject whence they come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If true ſanctification may be in one that is under the Covenant of workes, then muſt we of neceſſity change the articles or promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, &amp; make the promiſe of ſanctification no part of it; we muſt blot out thoſe promiſes of <hi>writing the law in our hearts,</hi> and <hi>putting a new ſpirit within us,</hi> and all other promiſes of the like nature, muſt be raſed out of the covenant of grace, if one under the Covenant of workes may attaine to this ſanctification by his owne workes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This opinion is directly croſſe and contrary to the Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. where he tells us, that we receive the ſpirit of Sanctification, not by the workes of the law, but by hearing of faith preached. It is the doctrine of grace, not of workes, which makes us partakers of this ſpirit. And hence it is that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. he tells us, that it is the new Teſtament which is the miniſtration of the Spirit, by which the Spirit is miniſtred and conveyed uto us. The law, or the workes of the law doe not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our being ſanctified, and our being Saints, is in effect all one, but we are Saints by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and our calling is by the Goſpel of Grace, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. and therefore our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from Grace alſo.</p>

               <p>Secondly, as it is thus in the extent, ſo it is alſo in reſpect of the ground and cauſe from which they iſſue and ſpring: Look then, as our Election is of Grace and not of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. and our Redemption is of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. ſo is our Sanctification alſo, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. Not according to the works which we had done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of the new birth, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt: ſo that the ſame grace, favour, and good will which moved the Father to ſet his love upon us in our Election, and cauſed the Sonne to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for our Redemption, the ſame Grace ſends or brings the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into our hearts to renew us unto holineſſe. And thence it is, that ſometimes we are ſaid to be choſen that we might be holy, as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. ſometimes ſaid to be redeemed that we might be holy, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. to the end that we might know that our ſanctification and renewing unto holineſſe doth come from the ſame grace, as doe our election and redemption; and therefore as our election is not of works, but of grace; and our redemption is not of works, but of grace; ſo it is alſo concerning our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I conclude therefore that by the works of the Law, no man being under the Law or Covenant of works, can attaine to true ſanctification and holineſſe. And if ſanctification be not by the Law or Covenant of works, then it neceſſarily and invincibly followes, that for a man to try his eſtate in Grace by his ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is no turning aſide to a Covenant of works.</p>
               <p>Thus much we do not unwillingly aſſent unto, namely that there
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:113533:103"/> is a kinde of outward ſanctification (improperly ſo called) or rather an outward reformation, which a man under the Covenant of Works may attayn unto. The Law hath a power not only to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate and provoke the luſt that is within, by its contrariety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. but alſo to curb and reſtrayn the breaking of it forth into outward acts, by the terrour of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. And by this reformation thus wrought by the work of reſtraynt, the unclean Spirit may ſeem to be caſt forth, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever reformation is thus wrought, is as farre from true ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as earth is from heaven: For though this reformation doth and may come from ſome inward work of the Spirit of God upon the ſpirit and ſoule of man, as namely to convince and terrifie the conſcience, to ſtirre the affections, and to awe the will alſo, ſo that a man dares not commit the things he would, yet the minde and will is ſtill unrenewed, the frame and diſpoſition of the heart is ſtill the ſame as it was before; and therefore this reformation is not true ſanctification. <hi>That</hi> may be by the Law, <hi>this</hi> is only by the Goſpel and from Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.29. it is ſaid of ſome, who in reſpect of their inward eſtate never went beyond a Covenant of works; yet of them it is ſaid that they were ſanctified by the blood of the Covenant, which is the blood of Chriſt; therefore ſuch as are under a Covenant of works may be ſanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a twofold ſanctification, one reall, another in profeſſion only. As ſome men are ſaid to beleeve when the work of faith is really wrought in the heart, who are therefore ſaid to be found in the faith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.13. and 2.2. ſo others are ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, only becauſe they make a profeſſion of faith, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. <hi>Simon</hi> himſelfe beleeved alſo &amp;c. i.e. he profeſſed to beleeve. And as it is in faith, ſo it is in ſanctification alſo. There is an holineſſe of truth really wrought, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. and there is an holineſſe of profeſſion, when we profeſſe to carry the lamp of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our hands, but want the oyle of grace in the veſſell of our heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 2 There is a ſanctification externall reaching to the purifying of the fleſh, ſtanding in the obſervance of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances of the Church; and there is another ſanctification internall, ſtanding in the inward purging of the conſcience from dead works, by which wee are enabled to ſerve the living God,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:113533:104"/> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. 3 There is a ſanctification to men, making us ſo to be eſteemed by men; and there is alſo a ſanctification to God, when we are ſo indeed in the ſight of God. Now this ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here ſpoken of was in profeſſion, externall, in reſpect of men, and in eſteem of men, but not reall, inward, and in reſpect of God, ſo as to make them holy and blameleſſe in his ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But they had reall gifts, as illumination, ſome delight in the word, and ſuch like, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. therefore they were really ſanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It followeth not, becauſe there may be ſome reall work wrought in the ſoule, which yet may not reach ſo farre as to reall and true ſanctification. There may be ſome morall diſpoſitions wrought in a man, which are reall in their kinde, and yet may come farre ſhort of true ſanctification. <hi>Object.</hi> As where there is the ſubſtance and being of a man, there is a true man; ſo where there is ſuch a being of reall gifts, there muſt needs be reall and true ſanctification. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Where there is the ſubſtance of a man there is a true man, if <hi>true</hi> be taken for <hi>verum naturale,</hi> which hath a true naturall exiſtence and being, and is not a meere <hi>ſpectrum,</hi> a phantaſm, an image or ſhadow of a thing. And thus taking <hi>true</hi> in this ſence, a rank theef is a true man. But take <hi>true</hi> for <hi>verum morale,</hi> for that morall truth which is required in the word, then may there be the ſubſtance of a man, head, armes, feet, &amp;c. and yet this man may not bee a true man conſidered thus morally: bring this man to the rule of the word, try his actions by the truth which the word requires, and then he which was found a true man in the former conſideration, will here be found a man falſe and deceitfull. So here, gifts may be really wrought in a man by a phyſicall work of the ſpirit, and yet bring theſe ſame gifts and the actions produced by them to the rule of the word, and try whether they will anſwer to the patterne of true ſanctification which the word layes down, and then their ſanctification will be found falſe, comming ſhort of that holineſſe of truth which is in the true Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But theſe here mentioned are ſaid to be ſanctified by the blood of the Covenant, that is the blood of Chriſt; but the blood of Chriſt doth not ſanctify only outwardly, as touching the purifying of the fleſh; but it purgeth the conſcience alſo within,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:113533:104"/> to ſerve the living God; and therefore theſe here mentioned were inwardly and truly ſanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The blood of Chriſt is taken either Properly, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally: Properly, as in 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. where he ſaith, <hi>the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Sonne clenſeth us from all ſinne:</hi> the blood in the ſpirituall efficacy of it being applyed unto us, doth indeed inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clenſe us from all ſinne. But ſometimes the blood of Chriſt is taken Sacramentally, and it is received Sacramentally only; and thus the Water in Baptiſm, and the Wine in the Supper, is the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and 11. Now this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall blood was ſprinkled upon them, they were waſhed with the Sacramentall blood of Chriſt in Baptiſm; but the ſpirituall efficacy of the blood it ſelfe never touched their conſcience, though the ſign of it might be ſprinkled on the outward man. And thus <hi>Paraeus, Erat eorum ſanctificatio non interna ſed externa, in profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one fidei &amp; participatione ſacramentorum externâ conſiſtens.</hi> They were ſanctified, that is, (ſayth he) they were by profeſſion ſegre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from the Iewes and Pagans, and were accounted for true Chriſtians or for Saints. To conclude, the anſwer to the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, the alluſion is to that of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.3. to 9. where <hi>Moſes</hi> makes up the Covenant betwixt God and the people: there <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt rehearſeth unto them the words of the Covenant, to which they ſhew themſelves willing to aſſent, <hi>verſe</hi> 3; then having taken order for the killing of the Sacrifice, the blood whereof was to ratify and confirm the Covenant, <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. next he takes part of the blood and ſprinkles it upon the people, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. uſing theſe words, <hi>behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you, concerning all theſe things.</hi> And now the people having thus farre accepted the terms and conditions of the Covenant, and accepted the blood of the Covenant, being willing to be ſprinkled with it: now (I ſay) this people was a ſanctified and holy people, a people in Covenant with God, ſeparated from the prophane peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the world, and were now eſteemed a peculiar and holy people, though yet many of them were not inwardly ſanctified, but only thus farre in reſpect of externall confederation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; ſo it is with theſe here ſpoken of, they were content to accept the ſprinkling of the ſacramentall blood upon them, and outwardly profeſſed themſelves willing (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did) to become
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:113533:105"/> the people of God; but yet all this while they were never in truth inwardly ſanctified, never waſhed with the waſhing of the new birth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. This alluſion I gather by the words of the Apoſtle, calling the blood here mentioned the blood of the Covenant; juſt the ſame expreſſion as <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed before, <hi>Behold the blood of the Covenant, Exod.</hi> 24.8. And look how the one blood was ſprinkled, ſo was the other; and what ſanctification was wrought by the one, the ſame was alſo by the other, namely an externall federall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; they having (both one and other) accepted the blood of the Covenant to be ſprinkled upon them, whereby they were ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified thus farre, as to become a ſeparate people unto God. So that (notwithſtanding all that which hath been objected, or can be) this ſtands good, that ſanctification is a bleſſing of the Covenant of Grace only: And being ſo, therefore to prove our juſtification by our ſanctification, is not to go aſide to a Covenant of works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Is our ſanctification a benefit of the Covenant of grace, and ſprings it from Grace? what then can our works of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation merit for us at the hands of God? what have wee herein which we have not received? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. of his own hand doe we give unto him, as <hi>David</hi> ſpake in another caſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. but of this there will be fitter place to ſpeak elſwhere.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. To teach us hereby to try our ſelves, whether we have any part in that ſalvation which God promiſeth in his Covenant: when we heare the Lord ſay as he doth herein my Text, <hi>As for thee alſo, thou ſhalt bee ſaved by the blood of thy Covenant;</hi> wee ſhould ſearch and ſee whether we have been made partakers of this ſalvation promiſed. But how ſhall we know that? even by our ſanctification, if the Lord hath renewed and ſanctified our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and made us new creatures in Chriſt. At what time God ſaveth his people, at the ſame time he ſanctifieth them. And thus he tells the Iſraelites, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. when he promiſeth them to bring them back into the Land which their Fathers dwelt in (which was unto them a type of heaven, and was therefore called the Lords Land, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.20.) he tells them withall, that when and at what time he would performe this unto them, at the ſame time he would poure out his ſpirit upon them, and would cleanſe them from their iniquities, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. ſutable to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. he hath ſaved us by the waſhing of the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:113533:105"/> new birth, and by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt. At what time God ſanctifieth us, at the ſame time he ſaveth us; he gives us the one as a pledge of the other. And therefore it is, that when the Lord had converted and ſanctified the heart of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and made him a new creature, hee did withall thus teſtifie unto him, <hi>This day is ſalvation come to thy ſoule,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9. Some do deny this way of triall, as if no evidence could bee had from our ſanctification, till we firſt know our election and juſtification by immediate revelation of the Spirit: This mediate witneſſe of the ſpirit which is by habituall and inherent graces, is not to be hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto, untill the immediate witneſſe hath ſpoken. But if there be no triall and knowledge of our eſtate to be had by habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace; then</p>
               <p n="1">1 What did Chriſt mean when he told his Diſciples, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhould all men know them to be his Diſciples, if they love one another? <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. What did <hi>Paul</hi> mean, when he bids us prove our ſelves whether we be in the faith or no? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>David</hi> ſurely was deceived, when he ſaid, <hi>hereby I know that I ſhall not be confounded, when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandements;</hi> if ſo be no knowledge of our good eſtate may be gathered hereby? Yea, to what end did <hi>Iohn</hi> lay down all thoſe ſignes and tokens of a bleſſed eſtate, which are ſcattered here and there through the whole firſt Epiſtle? his ſcope in that Epiſtle being this, even to give unto the faithfull ſome certaine evidence of their ſalvation, as is manifeſt by <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.13. And this being his ſcope, mark then how frequent and plentifull he is in bringing in evidences of this nature, as now we ſpeak of, as we may ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.7. <hi>If we walk in the light</hi> (of holineſſe) <hi>as he is in the light, then have we fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one with another</hi> (that is) God with us, and we with him; ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>hereby we are ſure that we know him</hi> (ſo as to have eternall life by the knowledge of him, <hi>John</hi> 17.3.) <hi>if we keep his Commandements;</hi> and in verſe 29. <hi>Know yee that he which doth righteouſneſſe is borne of him;</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.7. <hi>hee that doth righteouſneſſe</hi> (walking in the righteouſneſſe of a good conſcience, and upright converſation) <hi>is righteous</hi> (namely by imputation) <hi>even as Chriſt is righteous;</hi> and in verſe 9.10. <hi>he that is borne of God ſinneth not:</hi> In this are the children of God known from the children of the Devill, even by righteouſneſſe, and loving of our

               <p n="2">2. If there were no evidence to be taken hereby, this were to leave the work of the Spirit in as much darkneſſe and obſcurity, as is the work of the Father and the Son: But the work of the Spirit is to make known and manifeſt unto us the things that are given us of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. So long as the Fathers work of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtands alone, and is not accompanied with the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſanctification, his electing of us is ſo hidden in his own boſome, that none can tell what he will doe with any of the ſonnes of men, whether he will ſave any or deſtroy all: But when the ſonne comes and layes down his life for mans redemption, hee doth thereby bring to light the Fathers intention thus farre, that it is now known that certainly there be <hi>ſome</hi> whom the Lord will ſave: But yet who theſe <hi>(ſome)</hi> be, that is counſell ſtill, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; therefore in the third place the Spirit comes, and ſanctifies thoſe that are ſo choſen and redeemed. And now by this work of the Spirit, it is known not onely that there be ſome that God will ſave, but the very perſons themſelves are thereby ſingled out and marked; theſe have the ſeale and marke of God upon them, whereby they are known to bee the ſheep for which Chriſt laid down his life, according to the counſell and will of the Father; Even as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. when the Spirit came down upon Chriſt, then God witneſſed, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne:</hi> So it is here concerning our ſelves, hereby we have Gods witneſſe, teſtifying of us that we are his children, even by his Spirit of ſanctification which he hath ſent down into our hearts: By this we know that we are children redeemed and choſen; If we be ſanctified we are ſaved; Our ſalvation is begun, and ſhall be perfected in due time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But when the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>we</hi> know that wee are tranſlated from death &amp;c. his meaning is, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>we</hi> which have firſt received the ſeale and immediate witneſſe of the Spirit, <hi>we</hi> know &amp;c. but others cannot know it.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:113533:106"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not the meaning of the Apoſtle, as is evident to any one that with attention doth obſerve the ſcope and manner of the Apoſtles writing: The matter ſtands thus; There were a number in the Apoſtles time, ſuch as <hi>Iames</hi> elſewhere ſpeakes of, which profeſſed to know and believe in Chriſt, and <hi>would ſay,</hi> they had faith, as it is in <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.14 and yet they had no works: They <hi>would ſay</hi> they had fellowſhip with the Father, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.6. and yet they would walk in darkneſſe: They <hi>would ſay</hi> they knew God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.3. and yet would not keep his Commandements. They <hi>would ſay</hi> they did abide in Chriſt, and yet did not walk after the ſteps of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. They <hi>would ſay</hi> they were in the light, and yet would live in hatred of their brother, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. They <hi>would ſay</hi> they loved God, &amp; yet loved not their brethren, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.20. Now againſt theſe <hi>Sayers</hi> (as I may call them) that were all in profeſſion, and in word, ſaying, Lord, Lord, but not doing his will, againſt theſe I ſay, the Apoſtle oppoſeth theſe others which had the true work of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in their heart, and tells us that <hi>hereby</hi> we know &amp;c. Namely, if we doe not onely ſay we love the brethren, but doe indeed love them, &amp;c. hereby we know that we are paſſed from death to life. Thus by theſe expreſſions taken out of the Apoſtles own mouth, we ſee clearely who they are whom the Apoſtle meaneth by this (we) namely, not we onely who have received that immediate witneſſe of the Spirit, aſſuring us of our election and juſtification, but we alſo which have this work of ſanctification wrought in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may ſay, why ſhould we goe about to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence our juſtification by our ſanctification, rather then our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification by our juſtification?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe though they goe both together in time, yet they are not both alike in reſpect of manifeſtation: Our ſanctification is more manifeſt to us then is our juſtification. Its eaſier diſcerned: Firſt, becauſe our ſanctification is the work of the Spirit, whoſe part it is (as was ſaid before) to make known unto us the hid things of God; for which cauſe he is called the Spirit of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. Secondly, becauſe our ſanctification is a work within us, wrought in out own hearts; Our juſtification is an act of God without us, God not imputing to us our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; but our ſanctification is an inward work wrought in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:113533:107"/> a mans own bowels, of which he hath (and cannot but have) a ſenſible feeling in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But by this reaſon (may ſome ſay) a man may as well know his juſtification as his ſanctification, becauſe we are juſtified by faith, and faith is an inward Grace planted in the heart, as well as any other ſanctifying Grace which ſprings therefrom. And therefore we may know our juſtification by our faith, as well as by our ſanctification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, ſo farre as we diſcerne our faith, we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſcerne our juſtification alſo: But this makes for us, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, Though this withall is to be conſidered, that faith being as the root of all other Graces, is more hidden then they are, as the root of the tree is more hidden in the earth then the body or branches; but this we ſtand not upon: This therefore we would grant that a man may know his juſtification by his faith; but this toucheth not the point in hand. For when we goe about to try our juſtification by our ſanctification, and by qualifications inherent in us, in this way of tryall, faith is excluded, as much as any other ſanctifying Graces be. And the meaning of thoſe that doe oppoſe this way of evidencing by our ſanctification, is to remove all evidence by any thing in our ſelves, whether by faith or by any other Grace, and to urge only the immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Spirit; The ſumme is, that this is a ſafe way of tryall, being laid down unto us by the Lord himſelfe in the Word: And it is a poſſible way, in as much as our ſanctification is more evident then our juſtification, this being an act of God without us as was ſaid before, and that a work within us, which we feele and finde in our own ſoules. Would we then know whether we be of the number of thoſe that are ſaved by the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? we need not for this aſcend up into heaven, to ſearch the book of Gods election, nor need we to goe down into the lower parts of the earth, for any there to tell us that we are delive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed thence; but goe down into our own hearts, and if we finde this work of ſanctification there wrought, then what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of <hi>Iſrael, Bleſſed art thou O Iſrael, a people ſaved by the Lord,</hi> the ſame may be truly ſaid of us; Our ſalvation is begun, we have the ſeale of it, the earneſt, the firſt fruits, which ſhall at length bring the full poſſeſſion of the whole harveſt: <hi>Bleſſed therefore are they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:113533:107"/> which are undefiled in their way</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) which walk in the Law of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 119.1. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart,</hi> Matth. 5.8. <hi>Thoſe that have innocent hands, and a pure heart, ſhall ſurely aſcend into the mountaine of the Lord and ſtand in his holy place,</hi> Pſal. 24.3, 4. <hi>Such as theſe ſhall never be moved or confounded,</hi> Pſal. 15. end. But if in our hearts we doe ſtill nouriſh impurity, if we be fleſhly, carnall, ſuch as have not the Spirit, then have we no part nor portion in that ſalvation which the Covenant brings unto Gods people; <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. No unrighteous perſon, no uncleane thing ſhall enter into Gods Kingdome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall we diſcern our ſanctification to be right, ſincere, and ſound?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By the extent of it: It goes over the whole man, ſoule body and ſpirit, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. and therefore compared to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.33. which runnes through the dough till all bee leavened. As corruption had defiled all, ſo Grace ſanctifies all: The minde which was darkneſſe before is now light in the Lord, to know and underſtand the will of God, and to diſcerne things that differ: The judgement made to approve the good which is known, the will to deſire and endeavour after the doing of it: The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is made watchfull, and tender, fearefull to offend: The affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ordered aright to love the things which God loveth, and to hate the things which he hateth: The body is made an inſtrument to execute and doe that which is holy and good: Both body and ſpirit are Gods, ſet to doe the things that pleaſe him, by which he may be glorified: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. all that is within us and without, us is imployed to praiſe God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True Sanctification as it doth ſanctifie the whole man, ſo it doth forme the heart to a cloſing with the whole will of God without exception or reſervation: when God writes his Law in our hearts, he writes all his Commandements there, as he wrote all of them before in the Tables of ſtone; and they being all written in the heart, now we love all the Commandements of it, ſaying, as <hi>Paul, The Law is holy, and juſt, and good;</hi> now his Commandements are not burthenous or grievous, all are equall and right, we love all, embrace all, and labour to practice all; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of holineſſe towards God, duties of love and righteouſneſſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:113533:108"/> towards men, goe hand in hand in the life of a ſanctified Chriſtian: He makes account he hath done but half his duty, if either of theſe be omitted: He counts himſelfe as debtor to God and man to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and procure the good of men; and deſires to keep a cleare conſcience towards both, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. It is but falſe ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which neglects either of theſe duties, or any part of them; when we put on a forme of Religion, and yet deale unrighteouſly with men, this is curſed hypocriſie: And when we deale ſquarely with men, but are careleſſe Gallio's in the things of God, this is but a kinde of civill profaneſſe: there is no true ſanctification in one or other of them: True ſanctification cleaves to the whole law, and to all the Commandements of it, ſeeking to doe and fulfill all: ſuch an heart the Lord requires, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. and ſuch he works, where he works Grace in truth, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. True ſanctification will never ſuffer the ſoule to finde reſt and peace, but only in the way which is called holy: A ſanctified ſoule may ſtep aſide into the way which is not good, but it can finde no reſt there; Holineſſe ſtands in a conformity with God: It will not agree with any thing which is contrary to God, or to his will; a godly heart can finde no peace there. As on the one ſide a ſinfull heart may do the thing that is good, but it takes no pleaſure in ſuch things; ſo <hi>contrà</hi> the ſanctified heart, may by occaſion and by ſtrength of temptation, and prevailing power of inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be drawn to act amiſſe; but when hee hath done ſo, he finds no reſt in his ſpirit, till he be returned againe into the way of holineſſe which he had turned from. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſtept aſide, but what peace found he? <hi>Peter</hi> fell into ſhamefull denyall, but how grieved was he afterward? Thus <hi>Paul</hi> he confeſſed he did the evill that he would not; but how was he pained at the very heart, till he was rid of that body of ſinne? It was his continuall vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As the needle in the compaſſe may by ſhaking be turned from the right point, and from the pole, but it will finde no reſt till it be turned to it againe: So here. When therefore the heart ſinnes and finds reſt in it, and is not labouring to work out the corruption which is within, this is an evill ſign and dangerous; this argues a carnall diſpoſition, and an unſanctified Spirit. But when we are grieved for the evill which is in us, when our ſinne is counted our miſery, making us lament with <hi>Paul</hi> and ſay O miſerable man
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:113533:108"/> that I am &amp;c. and that not only as it troubles the conſcience, but as it cloggs the Spirit hindring us in well doing; this is a ſign of a ſanctified eſtate, and ſprings from a Spirit of grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. True ſanctification will make us moſt wary and watchfull againſt thoſe ſinnes which doe moſt ſtaine our holy profeſſion and blemiſh the glory of Chriſt, and make us moſt ſtudious of thoſe things in which God is moſt glorified: As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>I can doe nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth;</hi> ſo indeed a ſanctified ſoule can doe nothing againſt Gods glory, but all things for his glory. Sanctity devotes a man unto God, he is for God, not for himſelfe, not for the world, he accounts himſelfe that he is Gods. If we live we live for God; whether we eat or drink or labour or reſt, we doe them for God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. If we get riches, we grow rich for God, to honour God with our riches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. Our whole life is for God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. This is a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied diſpoſition, when it is thus with us: And when otherwiſe we eat for our ſelves as <hi>Zachary</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.6. we labour for our ſelves, get riches for our ſelves, not caring how our profeſſion is blemiſhed, and God diſhonoured by our worldly and coveteous converſation; this is from the fleſh, which loves its own, and minds its own things, and not the things of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. True ſanctification makes a man affect ſociety with thoſe that are holy: Its a good ſigne when the heart doth inwardly cleave to thoſe that excell in grace; eſpecially, when it is for Grace ſake and becauſe of the Grace that is in them. There may be an outward complying with them, and ſome externall ſociety had with them alſo, when yet the heart is not with them; there may be ſome ſutableneſſe of diſpoſition, ſome morall qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in a godly ſoule, which may give content unto a carnall heart; but to love them inwardly, and that not for any other reſpect but for the grace which is in them, this is from a ſutable Spirit of grace working in our ſelves: Thus it was with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 16.3. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. Come unto mee all yee that feare God &amp;c. and away from me ye wicked, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. True ſanctification makes us aſpire after communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God himſelfe; it loves fellowſhip with the Saints, but reſts not in them, but aſpires higher; nothing will ſatisfie a ſanctified ſoule, but God; yea, it is God which he loves and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:113533:109"/> ſeeks in his Saints. So it is alſo in the uſe of Ordinances, they are all empty things without God, unleſſe the Lord be there; The Word, Prayer, Sacraments, are but leane and empty things, unleſſe hee enjoy God in them; He is the fat, the marrow, and ſweetneſſe of them all: when God meets the ſoule in any of theſe, it is then ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſſe; but when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes and abſents himſelfe, it findes no ſatiety, no relliſh in any thing: The ſoule is empty ſtill, till <hi>he</hi> fill it, who is the fulneſſe of all things: God only doth fill and ſatisfie the ſoule that is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; See <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.4. There you ſhall ſee the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and children of <hi>Iudah</hi> together comming to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the place of Gods worſhip; but is that all they goe for? No, ſaith the Prophet, they goe ſeeking the Lord their God; they goe to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to worſhip there; but there is a further thing they ſeek for, even God himſelfe; without whom, <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and Temple, and all would be but as a ſolitary cave in a wilderneſſe, if God were not found there; This Gods ſervants finde in frequent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Sometimes they finde God ſweetly preſent with them in prayer, Sacrament, or the like, and then they goe away as a man refreſhed with new wine: Sometimes they ſeek him but find him not, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. and then they are like men that faine would eat to the ſatisfying of their hungry ſoule, but they want their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed food: or like thoſe in the Prophet, they doe eat, but they are not ſatisfied, they have not enough: <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom?</hi> there are Angels, there are Saints, the Spirits of juſt and perfect men, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. Are all theſe nothing with <hi>David?</hi> Theſe were in heaven, and are alſo in earth: yet ſaith <hi>David, Whom have I in heaven or earth but thee?</hi> Theſe are good with God; but not able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie a ſanctified ſoule without God: If it were poſſible for ſuch a ſoule to be in heaven it ſelfe, there to enjoy all the glory of it, and communion with all the company of Saints and Angels there, yet if it ſhould not there enjoy God, it would ſay, I finde not him whom my ſoule loveth and longeth for; where is he? I muſt finde him ere my joy can be full. Thus a ſanctified heart aſpires to fellowſhip with, and enjoyment of God himſelfe; It ſtayes not till it come to the top of the ladder where God is; Ordinances are as ſo many ſteps to aſcend up unto him, be only is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:113533:109"/> the end which the godly heart ſeeks in them; when we reſt in them, not ſeeking or not finding God in them, this is but formality, not true ſanctity: True ſanctity ſtayes not till we can ſay as 1 <hi>

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. True ſanctification makes us exceeding ſenſible of our own wants and weakneſſes in Grace; making us to ſee how farre ſhort we come of that perfection which ſhould be in us: Thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſtrove unto a conformity wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Its a true ſaying, <hi>He that wants nothing in Grace, hath nothing;</hi> others there are which are ever wanting, ever craving &amp; begging, as men that are made up of wants, ſeeing ſuch abundance of corruption in themſelves, that it makes them to abhorre themſelves when they come before God; only this they doe, they are ſtill purging themſelves in that fountaine of Grace, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. ſeeking to grow up to full holineſſe in his feare, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Theſe are ſanctified ſoules, ſuch Chriſt pronounceth bleſſed; <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in Spirit, Bleſſed are theſe that thus hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe. Matth.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There bee ſundry ſanctified affections and diſpoſitions, which doe ſhew forth true ſanctification were it is: As</p>
               <p>Firſt, holy mourning for ſinne, when our ſinne is our chiefeſt ſorrow, as it was in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a chuſing of the way of Grace; when godlineſſe and Grace with loſſe accompanying them, are choſen and preferred before riches and treaſures of the world, doing as <hi>Moſes</hi> who choſe affliction, rather then the treaſures of <hi>Aegypt, Heb.</hi> 11. and <hi>David</hi> who ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>I have choſen the way of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, &amp;c.</hi> What ever befall us, this is our reſolution, in this way I will live, in this I will die.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a caring and taking thought for the things of Chriſt; <hi>Paul</hi> that chiefeſt of Saints, had his head full of theſe cares, even
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:113533:110"/> cumbred with them every day: This was from the abundant Grace of God which was in him; thoſe that are after the fleſh, they take thought for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. but thoſe that are after the ſpirit, they take thought for the things of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, an holy zeale and earneſtneſſe for good, to be active and working for Chriſt, with an holy emulation and contention of Spirit, being provoked thereto not only by the zeale of others, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. but even by their lukewarmneſſe; the <hi>leſſe they</hi> doe <hi>we</hi> will doe the <hi>more,</hi> and ſeek to draw on others by our example; loth that any ſhould bee more forward in evill then wee for good.</p>
               <p>By theſe things try we our ſelves, try we our ſanctification; where theſe things are, there is the Spirit of holineſſe; and where they are not in ſome degree more or leſſe, there the Spirit of Grace is not, nor have thoſe (that doe wholly want theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named) any part or portion in any ſaving bleſſing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. For direction unto all Gods people which have given up themſelves by Covenant unto God; Theſe doe many times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the power of their corruptions prevailing againſt them; They ſee ſo much ſinfull uncleaneſſe in themſelves, that it makes them to doubt whether the Spirit of Grace ever had any abiding in them. Now for theſe, here is direction how to get help, that they may become pure, holy, undefiled, and clean from their ſin; Let them look unto the promiſes of this Covenant, which God hath made with his people: Here is a fountaine of Grace opened unto them to waſh in; God hath promiſed, <hi>That he will poure clean water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and will cleanſe them from all their filthineſſe, Ezek.</hi> 3.25. He hath ſaid, he will waſh away the filthineſſe of the daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi> that they may be cleane. Are you then Ieprous and unclean in your own eyes? Goe then and waſh ſeven times in theſe waters of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and ſo your leproſie ſhall depart from you: Goe to God and plead his Covenant and promiſe, and ſay unto God, Lord, thou haſt made promiſes unto thy ſervants, that thou wilt not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the ſinnes of thy people, but that thou wilt ſanctifie them, and make them an holy people unto thee; why then am I ſtill thus corrupt, ſinfull and uncleane? Lord, waſh me, waſh me throughly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:113533:110"/> till I be cleane from all my ſin. This is our way to get help againſt our corruptions; wee think (for the moſt part) that if we have ſinned, we muſt indeed goe to God for pardon and forgiveneſſe; but we think we muſt work out our ſanctification of our ſelves, by our own watchfulneſſe, reſolutions, vowes and promiſes made unto God: But herein we wrong our ſelves; were there not more help in Gods promiſes which he makes to us, then in our promiſes to him, we might lie in our pollutions for ever; we muſt therefore goe to God for help againſt all our corruptions, ſeeking to him by faith in his Covenant and promiſe, ſaying as <hi>Iehoſhaphat, Lord, I am ſo borne downe by the power of my ſinne, that I know not what to doe; only mine eyes are unto thee; doe thou ſubdue mine iniquities, doe thou help me.</hi> The whole life of a Chriſtian is a life of faith; the life of juſtification, the life of ſanctification; <hi>we live both theſe lives by the faith of the Sonne of God, Gal.</hi> 2.20. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ſaid to be ſanctified by faith, becauſe by faith we ſeek for, and receive the Spirit of ſanctification which is promiſed unto us. Herein then lies our help. What is the reaſon that after ſo many reſolutions, againſt ſuch or ſuch a ſinne, yet we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come againe and againe? It is (in a great part) becauſe we look at the victory againſt them to come as from our ſelves; we think this or that ſhall doe it: but the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that the victory by which we muſt overcome, is our faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4 Reſt upon Gods faithfulneſſe for help and ſtrength againſt ſinne, as well as for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinne: And then though there be no help on earth, yet we ſhall ſee that there is help in heaven; though none in our ſelves, yet there is in God and in his faithfull Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. To ſtirre up thoſe that doe yet finde themſelves deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all Grace not able to diſcern the leaſt ſpark of goodneſſe in themſelves; let them (notwithſtanding) conſider what God hath promiſed in his Covenant: He hath therein promiſed a new heart, a new ſpirit, to create us anew in Chriſt Jeſus: He hath promiſed to poure out waters upon the dry ground, <hi>Eſay</hi> 44.3. where there is no ſap, no moiſture, no goodneſſe, but their moiſture is turned into the drought of Sommer: yet upon ſuch dry grounds, on ſuch dry trees, the waters of the Spirit ſhall be poured out, and they ſhall be made to bring forth fruit. The wilde forreſt of <hi>Lebanon</hi> ſhall become as Carmell, the Deſart a fruitfill Field; goe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:113533:111"/> therefore thou poore loſt creature, thou ſinfull ſoule, who never yet to this day hadſt one drop of Grace wrought in thy heart; goe thou to the Throne of Grace, lament thy ſinfull and wicked heart before God, begge this mercy of him, ſay unto him, Lord, thou haſt promiſed to give thy Spirit unto ſuch as aske him of thee. Now Lord give it unto me a poore ſinfull creature; make me, even me alſo a partaker of this bleſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all to ſeek after this bleſſing: Conſider with your ſelves three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The extent of theſe promiſes; <hi>I will poure out my Spirit upon all fleſh, Joel.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Whoſoever is thirſty, come, and drink of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life freely;</hi> yea, turne you (ſaith Chriſt to ſcornfull ſinners) at my correction; and then behold, <hi>I will poure out my Spirit upon you:</hi> And in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. compare <hi>verſe</hi> 20. with 25, 26. There you may ſee that thoſe upon whom he promiſeth to poure his Spirit, they were ſuch as had polluted Gods name among the Heathen and made it to be blaſphemed; and yet even to thoſe the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth that (when the time of Grace was come, for mercy to manifeſt it ſelfe in them) upon them hee would poure out his Spirit and cleanſe them from all their uncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the freeneſſe of theſe promiſes; <hi>come and buy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money or money-worth,</hi> Iſai. 55.2. <hi>drink of the waters of life freely,</hi> Apoc. 22.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider Chriſt forwardneſſe and readineſſe to give to every one that askes; hadſt thou but asked (ſaith Chriſt to the woman in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.20.) <hi>I would have given thee the water of life:</hi> Mark the place and occaſion of Chriſts words: Chriſt being then weary and thirſty by reaſon of his journey, he askes of the woman a cup of water to drink; no great matter to give, bring but a cup of water;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:113533:111"/> and being by the well ſide, where was water enough and ready at hand yet ſhe gives it not but ſtands wondering that he being a Iew ſhould aske water of her that was a <hi>Samaritane;</hi> well ſaith Chriſt, thou denyeſt me a cup of cold water to drink, being weary and thirſty; but hadſt thou asked of me, I would have given thee the water of life: Nay, and did give it unto her, though ſhee denyed him a cup of water out of the well, yet Chriſt gave her the water of life. What would the Lord Ieſus have us to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in this his ſpeech unto her, and her dealing towards him, but that he is more forward to give that water of life (his holy Spirit) to a poore ſinner, then we are to give a cup of common water to a thirſty ſoule? O bleſſed redeemer, who would not come unto thee? Goe therefore thou that haſt denyed the leaſt mercy and kindneſſe to Chriſt in any of his members, though thou haſt thought a cup of water too much for them, yet ſeek grace from him; Aske his Spirit, intreat him to make thy heart new within thee, doe but aske and ſeek, and he will doe more then thou canſt hope or think; plead the promiſe of his Covenant and wait in hope. Thus much for the third benefit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth benefit which God promiſeth unto his in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is our preſervation in the ſtate of Grace to which we are called: This is a part of his Covenant with us, that he once taking us to be a people unto him in Chriſt, he will never forſake us any more, but keep us in that eſtate for ever: And by this promiſe the Lord takes away that laſt great ſcruple which the ſoule is apt to make in this manner; although (may one think) the Lord hath ſhewed mercy unto me thus farre, that he hath given me hope of the forgiveneſſe of my ſinnes paſt, and hath changed my heart in ſome meaſure, ſo as it is my deſire to do his will; yet for all this I finde ſtill ſuch ſtrong oppoſition againſt mee by enemies within and without, ſo many corruptions within, and temptations from without, that I ſhall never be able to hold out unto the end; but as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of</hi> Saul; ſo thinks the ſoule here in mids of many purſuits by the enemy; I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Sathan; I ſhall not be able to withſtand him. Now to this feare of our heart, the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers by this promiſe and benefit, which he hath Covenanted to make good unto us; he undertakes to keep us in the ſame eſtate of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:113533:112"/> Grace to which he hath brought us; he tells us, no, yee ſhall never periſh, feare it not; he which hath begun the work will perfect it in us and for us; And as God ſaid unto <hi>Iacob,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.15. <hi>I am with thee, I will keep thee</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I will not forſake thee, till I have performed unto thee all that I have promiſed thee;</hi> So he ſaith unto us, <hi>I will keep you, till I have perfected towards you all the good pleaſure of my goodneſſe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.11. <hi>I will keep you in my own hand, I will guide you by my councell, and afterward will bring you to glory,</hi> Pſal. 73. This bleſſing we have promiſed to us, in <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.39.40. <hi>They ſhall fear me for ever, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them that I wil never turn away from them to doe them good, but I will put my feare into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me:</hi> and in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.8. <hi>With everlaſting mercy have I had compaſſion on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer; For this is unto me as the waters of</hi> Noah; <hi>for as I have ſworn, that the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>ſhall no more goe over the earth: ſo have I ſworr, that I would not be angry with thee. The mountaines ſhall remove, and the hills ſhall fall down, but my mercy ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the Covenant of my peace fall away, ſaith the Lord that hath compaſſion on thee.</hi> Plentifull is the Scripture in ſuch promiſes as theſe, In <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>I will marry thee unto my ſelfe, &amp;c:</hi> when the Lord marrieth us to himſelfe, he doth it with a purpoſe to be ours for ever; whom God loves once with this conjugall love, hee loves them for ever unto the end, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.2. And thence it is that thoſe that are truly regenerate and ſanctified, are compared to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which cannot be removed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.1. And to a tree planted by the river of water, which continually flouriſheth, and withers not, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. and to an houſe built upon a Rock, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. And hence is that glorious triumph of the Apoſtle, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all contrary power at a defiance; <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God? &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 8.33. <hi>Neither heigth, nor depth, nor things preſent, nor things to come ſhall ever ſeparate us from the love of God, wherewith he hath loved us in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and in 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>Hence forth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſnes:</hi> And thence was that confident ſpeech of the Prophet in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>Thou wilt guide me by thy counſell, and afterward bring me to glory.</hi> This benefit the Lord will fulfill unto his people; when he hath begun the work of his Grace, he will finiſh it unto the day of

                  <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> which reach a falling away from Grace, know not the difference between the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace. Their Doctrine of the Apoſtacy of the Saints, that thoſe that are adopted, ſanctified, and planted into Chriſt, may fall away and periſh, is a doctrine contrary to the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Covenant of Grace, injurious unto God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable unto the Saints. It is true that there is a kinde of ſeeming holineſſe which may be loſt, a forme of godlineſſe which may vaniſh and come to nought, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 6. &amp; 10.29. Its true alſo that Gods own people called and choſen may much damp &amp; quench the Grace of God which is in them, and may ſhew much infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in particular falls, which they are ſubject unto, being ſometimes ſo farre left unto themſelves, as we ſee in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. Acts of grace may be interrupted in them for a ſeaſon, ſenſe of it may be much leſſened, power of it weakned, the degree of it abated: but the habit cannot be utterly loſt, the life of it never goes out; a man may be in a ſwoun, and yet his life be in him ſtill. The certainty of the Saints perſeverance is built upon theſe foundations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God is able to ſtabliſh them, and therefore they ſhall be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed He is able to keep us <hi>Iude</hi> 24. He is able to make us ſtand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25. and therefore we ſhall never be removed nor overthrown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But this is a weak argument to reaſon from Gods power to his will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then the Apoſtle himſelfe argues weakly, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. where ſpeaking of the weak believer, hee ſaith that ſuch an one ſhall bee eſtabliſhed; and how proves he that? becauſe God is able to make him ſtand. This is the Apoſtles Argument: Indeed its true, God will not doe all things which he can doe; he can out of the ſtones and rocks raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> but he neither doth it nor will doe it: But though God will not doe all things which he can, yet he will doe all things which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to doe. Now this is Gods promiſe (as we have ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that he will preſerve his people; and therefore if he can doe it, ſurely, he will doe it, becauſe he hath promiſed it. And hence it is that in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.28, 29. Chriſt argues from the power of God, &amp; doth by that argument prove the undoubted ſalvation of thoſe that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:113533:113"/> believe, namely becauſe God is in power greater then all, and none is able to pull them out of his hand: Indeed till we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, there is no arguing from Gods power; no man can ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly argue that God will out of ſtones raiſe up children to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> becauſe he never promiſed it; but when we have the promiſe, then we may reaſon from his power: And thus did <hi>Abraham</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I ſhall have a Sonne (ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi>) becauſe (though my body bee as good as dead, yet) God is able to doe it. The argument was good, becauſe God had before promiſed to doe it. So in the caſe in hand; God hath ſaid that he will keep us to his heavenly Kingdome; and therefore if he can doe it, he will doe it; he hath engaged all his power and goodneſſe to be for our ſalvation; God is ours, his power is ours to ſtabliſh and ſtrengthen us that we fall not; yea, here are two immutable things to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us; the power and will of God. Theſe two are as the two pillars before <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple; <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz: Boaz</hi> ſignifying (in him is <hi>ſtrength</hi>) and <hi>Iachim</hi> (he <hi>will</hi> ſtabliſh:) theſe two pillars ſtand together to eſtabliſh all thoſe that are ready to fall; if there be <hi>ſtrength</hi> in him, he would have us to know that he <hi>will</hi> put it forth for our eſtabliſhment, that we might bee ſupported by his power; his power and will ſtand together to ſupport us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the gifts of God which accompany ſalvation, are given without repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. God never repents him of the Grace he hath ſhewed to his people that he knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Hence is that in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. when God promiſeth to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that he would take of his ſeed, and ſet upon his Throne after him, and then ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will be his Father, and he ſhall bee my Sonne, and my mercy will I not take away from him, as I took a from</hi> Saul; to teach us when hee hath once brought us into the ſtate of Adoption, to be his ſonnes, he will never ceaſe to follow us with Fatherly love, he will never take away his Fatherly mercy from us: adde hereto that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 46.3.4. and <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It would ſhake the foundation of Gods election, if thoſe that are once ſanctified ſhould fall away and periſh; for thoſe onely whom he knew before, thoſe onely doth he ſanctifie: If he hath in mercy drawn us unto himſelfe, its a ſign he hath loved us from everlaſting, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.3. our calling and ſanctification is according, to his purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.30. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. Thoſe that are ſanctified,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:113533:113"/> juſtified and called, are all firſt choſen: And thence faith is called the faith of Gods elect, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. and thoſe that are ſanctified are ſaid to be choſen unto it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4. And why are theſe things ſaid to flow from Gods election, but that we knowing that that foundation of Gods election remaineth ſure, we might know that our ſtate in Grace is ſure alſo, as being built on that foundation which cannot be moved? And this doth our bleſſed Saviour make good in that ſpeech of his in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. where ſpeaking of the ſtrong deluſions and deceits which many ſhould be deceived with, he ſaith, <hi>that thoſe deceivers ſhall ſhew forth ſuch ſignes and wonders as if it were poſſible, ſhould deceive the very Elect:</hi> If it were poſſible, but that they cannot doe, the Elect cannot periſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It would fruſtrate the vertue and efficacy of the mediation and interceſſion of the Lord Ieſus, who not onely once offred up himſelfe, as a ſacrifice for us, but appeares for ever at the right hand of the Father to make interceſſion for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. That prayer of his <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. which he made for us when he was here upon earth, was and is a teſtification of the care he hath of us now in heaven: He then prayed, Father keep them in thy name; and the ſame doth he for us now: He is not changed, he is yeſterday and to day and the ſame for ever; he is our faithfull High-Prieſt, who beares our names upon his breaſt in the holy place he is now entred into, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.29. preſenting us with his heartieſt affection unto his Father, he having ſet us a ſeale upon his heart, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying us in his boſome, and loving us with his boſome love. This comfort Chriſt gave unto <hi>Peter; I have prayed for thee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that thy faith faile not, Luke</hi> 22.32. And look what Chriſt prayed for in the behalfe of <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the ſame prayer he makes for all thoſe that believe in him through their word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20. And if Chriſt make ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us, we know that he is alwayes heard and accepted by the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. It is not poſſible that thoſe for whom he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes, ſhould periſh.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If there were falling away from Grace, then it muſt come either by Gods departing from us, or by our departing from him: But neither of theſe ſhall do it; neither will God depart from us, not ſhall we (when once effectually called) depart any more from him <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. He will not forſake his people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22. Nor
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:113533:114"/> will they goe away from him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.68. Lord whether ſhall we goe? thou haſt the fountaine of life and bleſſedneſſe in thee; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould we goe to forſake thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>Adam</hi> who had perfect holineſſe in him, and had more grace then we have, did fall; therefore we which have leſſe grace then he, may fall much more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It followes not; becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> and we are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered under different Covenants: <hi>Adam</hi> was under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; thoſe that are regenerate, are under a Covenant of Grace; He was therefore left to himſelfe to work either in one kinde or other, well or ill, as he would himſelfe; but now we are under a Covenant of Grace, and are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. he had no promiſe of being kept as we have; He had that which we have not, <hi>Poſſe ſi vellet,</hi> he had power to have ſtood, but abuſed his will; we have that which he had not, we have will, but we want power; but though we want power of our own, yet we are kept by the power of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But we have no promiſe of being kept in the ſtate of Grace, but onely ſo farre as wee are not wanting to our ſelves, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If ſo, no fleſh ſhould bee ſaved; for who is not wanting to himſelfe more or leſſe? Are thoſe that plead thus, ſo watchfull and diligent never to be wanting to themſelves? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they dare not for ſhame once affirm it; and yet I believe, they will not therefore ſay, that becauſe of ſuch want, they are fallen from Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this were all that God promiſed unto us now under Grace, then I demand, what have we promiſed to us more then was promiſed to <hi>Adam?</hi> for ſurely if <hi>Adam</hi> had not been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to himſelfe, he ſhould have continued ſtill in that holy eſtate; And if the Lord ſhould now promiſe us no more, what grace is ſhewed to us more then to him? where is the Grace of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant above the firſt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord hath promiſed this alſo, that we ſhall never be ſo farre wanting to our ſelves, as wholly to turn away from him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40. He puts into the hearts of his people an holy feare of departing away from him; they feare to be deprived, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. This feare makes them pray, <hi>knit my heart unto thee,</hi> and to reſolve
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:113533:114"/> with <hi>David, It is good for me to draw nigh unto God, Pſal.</hi> 73. And thus in <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.39. <hi>I will give them one heart that they ſhall feare me for ever.</hi> This fearing him <hi>for ever</hi> makes Gods children <hi>for ever</hi> to cleave to him, ſo as though they may have their particular ſlips and failings, yet they can no more ceaſe to feare God, and to cleave unto him, then this promiſe of God can faile, wherein hee hath ſaid, <hi>I will give them an heart to feare me for ever.</hi> At what time they ceaſe to feare God, at the ſame time, this promiſe of God failes and comes to nought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But theſe promiſes which doe ſound as if they were abſolute, are to be expounded by other promiſes which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed conditionally, if yee continue, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. if yee faint not, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe conditionall expreſſions are added, not to weaken the force of thoſe abſolute promiſes before named, as if one ſort of promiſes did croſſe another, and were to weaken our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them: but there are two other cauſes of adding theſe conditions. One is this: Namely, becauſe the Apoſtle in writing to viſible Churches, hee knew that in all ſuch Churches there were ſome, that though they made as faire profeſſion as the reſt, yet they would in time diſcover ſome unſoundneſſe at heart; for their ſakes therefore the Apoſtle addes theſe (Ifs) as if hee ſhould ſay, if yee be truly grounded on Chriſt and ſo continue, then ſhall yee be preſented blameleſſe, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22, 23. but this doth nothing at all tend to weaken the aſſurance of thoſe that are truly called and ſanctified. The other is this; Theſe conditionall expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have in them the force of a ſecret warning and quickning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation for every one that ſtandeth or thinks that he ſtandeth to take heed leſt he fall; and ſo in ſtead of weakning our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they make us to ſtand more cautelouſly and ſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a ſweet and uſefull conſideration obſerved by that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Lawyer, and active. Inſtrument in the Cauſe of Gods truth, that in the comparing and compounding of theſe conditionall promiſes with the abſolute, we muſt place conditionall in the firſt rank, and then abſolute in the ſecond: Set the former as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Propoſition, the later as the minor; as thus. If yee continue, yee ſhall be ſaved: here is the conditionall promiſe in the major; then followes; But yee ſhall continue, yee ſhall never depart from
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:113533:115"/> me; Here is the abſolute promiſe in the Minor; whence followes the concluſion of aſſurance in the conſcience of the believer, I ſhall be ſaved. The inverting of this order, breeds the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and confuſion, when they ſet the conditionall after the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> We grant (ſaith the Jeſuite) we may be aſſured, that God will hold his promiſe; but no man can aſſure himſelfe of the uſe of his particular will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then belike the Grace of God and efficacy of it muſt depend wholly upon the will of man: So that where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy;</hi> we muſt now change the Text, and ſay, It is in man that willeth, and not in God that ſheweth mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But to what end are thoſe caveats and warnings given, to take heed of falling away from the Grace of God, if ſo be that thoſe which are under Grace cannot fall from Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They ſerve to keep the Saints more watchfull, by which watchfulneſſe they are helped to ſtand more firmely: They are thereby admoniſhed of their owne infirmity, and made more carefull to reſt on Chriſt, by whom they are preſerved: 2. They ſerve alſo to leave all Hypocrites and Apoſtates without excuſe, they being warned of the danger, but they would not take heed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But this Doctrine of Perſeverance is a Doctrine of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, tending to make men careleſſe, when they know they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall nor periſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It doth indeed breed an holy ſecurity, that knowing theſe promiſes which the Lord hath made unto us, thus to keep us for ever unto himſelfe, now we may ſay as the holy Prophet, <hi>I will even lay me down and ſleep in peace, for the Lord ſuſtaineth me: And though Legions of Divells beſet me round about, yet I will truſt in this, The Lord is my life and ſalvation; of whom ſhould I be afraid? he will deliver me from every evill work, and preſerve me blameleſſe to his heavenly Kingdome.</hi> This holy peace and bleſſed ſecurity doth indeed flow from the doctrine delivered, but not that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and carnall ſecurity which theſe men meane: Look into the Saints who have felt moſt aſſurance hereof in themſelves, and ſee whether it wrought any ſuch effect in them; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:113533:115"/> wilt guide me by thy counſell, and afterward wilt bring me to glory, Pſal.</hi> 73. But did this his aſſurance make him carnally ſecure? did he now conclude with himſelfe, I may now take mine own liberty, and live as I liſt? No ſuch thought entred into his heart, but the contrary; <hi>it is good for me to draw nigh unto God:</hi> It made him to love God more, and to cleave unto him in his inward affection, and to make God the portion of his ſoule for ever. And ſo the Apoſtle; who more aſſured then <hi>Paul? Rom.</hi> 8. yet who ever more watchfull and more zealous for Chriſt? Certainly, they know not what this aſſurance is, which think this to bee the fruit of it, to make us carnally ſecure and careleſſe of well doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If the Lord will thus ſtabliſh and keep his Saints from falling, how and by what meanes doth he effect it, and bring it to paſſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here are two things concurring: Firſt, an inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and work of faith wrought in us, inherent and abiding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us: Secondly, an externall aſſiſting power of God upholding and ſtrengthening that weak faith which is in us, and treading down our enemies under our feet: Both theſe are joyned together in that one ſaying of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Wee are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation:</hi> Here is ſaith within us, and the power of God without us, both united and working together to keep us unto ſalvation. Faith makes us ſee wherein our ſtrength lyeth, not in our ſelves, but in God through Chriſt; being then ſenſible of our own infirmity and weakneſſe, faith flies unto this power of God to be kept by him: Faith ſpeaks in the heart of a Chriſtian as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> did 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>Lord I know not what to doe, I am not able to ſtand againſt all this multitude of enemies which beſet my ſoule on evey ſide, but mine eyes are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, I reſt on thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. And then the ſoule thus looking unto God by the eye of faith, and reſting upon his power; now the power of God comes in for our help, ſo as faith ſtands ſtill to ſee and behold the ſalvation of God; And hereto agrees that of the Prophet <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.3. <hi>The Lord keeps in perfect peace the minde which is ſtaid on him:</hi> We ſtay upon him by faith, and he keeps us in peace and ſafety by his power; And to the ſame purpoſe is that in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. where we are exhorted to ſtand faſt in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:113533:116"/> the power of his might; we muſt have recourſe unto the power of his might by faith, and then we ſhall ſtand faſt, and never be moved; Now as wee have ſeen that the Lord will preſerve his people in the ſtate of Grace to which he hath called them, ſo let us conſider what grace is herein ſhewed unto us from God, and what benefit comes thereby unto our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Here is Grace from God; For by Grace we ſtand; were we left unto our ſelves, we ſhould ſoone doe as our firſt Father did; There is naturally the ſame revoking Spirit in us, as was in him; an aptneſſe and inclination of heart, ready to depart away, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. loving to wander, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.10. we have alſo the ſame Enemy, the ſame Tempter to draw us, with like temptations from our communion with God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.41. And in thoſe that are not preſerved by Grace, theſe things (corruption within, and temptation without) doe prevaile ſo farre, as to turn back many who ſeemed to begin in the Spirit, to cauſe them to make an end in the fleſh: They turning back againe after their waſhing, to the wallowing in the mire.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.</note> Its Grace therefore whereby we ſtand, elſe we ſhould fall as well as they.</p>
               <p>And a ſingular benefit it is, conſidering that without this one, all the former bleſſings, to have God to be a God in Covenant with us, to have our ſinnes forgiven, to have our natures renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſanctified, all theſe (I ſay) were evacuated and made as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if this one bleſſing of perſeverance were wanting; for then we might loſe our intereſt in God againe, we might come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine under the guilt of ſinne, &amp;c. and what benefit then of all this, that ſometime we had God for our God? we had our ſinne forgiven, but now all this is diſanulled; we have loſt God againe, and are now enſnared againe in the ſnare of our ſinnes: It is therefore no leſſe bleſſing to be kept in a ſtate of Grace, then to be brought into it. And then, conſider alſo the danger of Apoſtacy that the end of ſuch is worſe then was their beginning, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. though their beginning was naught, ſinfull, and miſerable, yet their end is worſe: And it had been better for them never to have known the way of righteouſneſſe, then when they have known it, to turn from it: Such ſhall receive the ſorer vengeance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. The greater the danger is of falling back, the greater is the bleſſing in being preſerved in the grace in which we ſtand.</p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:113533:116"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This ſerves for endleſſe comfort unto all the Saints of God. Temporary bleſſings yeeld temporary refreſhings; but this benefit of perſeverance aſſures us of good things more abiding and eternall, in the conſideration whereof we ſhould be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with endleſſe comfort, everlaſting joy ſhould be upon our heads, <hi>Eſay</hi> 35.10. Be our enemies, never ſo ſtrong and mighty, our infirmities never ſo many, yet ſhall neither their ſtrength, nor our weakneſſes expoſe us to their will, but we ſhall be kept ſafe unto ſalvation by a divine power which is above all and over all; The Lyons may roare at us, but they ſhall not teare us in pieces; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may purſue us with his Chariots and horſemen; but wait awhile and we ſhall ſee the Lord fight for <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> wee ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.13. when Chriſt was there praying to his Father in the behalfe of his Diſciples (which prayer he uttered before them in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and audience) marke what he did aime at in it, which was that they might have his joy fulfilled in themſelves: Hee was commending them by prayer unto his Father, that he would keep them in his name, and preſerve them from evill; that none of them might be loſt. And this he did, that they knowing how Chriſt the beloved Sonne interceded with the Father for them, might be filled with comfort, as knowing that his petitions put up for them could not poſſibly return in vaine. This makes our joy a full joy, that we are not only brought into a ſtate of Grace, to have God for our God, and to have our ſinnes forgiven &amp;c. but we ſhall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ept in this eſtate for ever. Though we be not yet exempted from falling into ſinne through manifold infirmities, yet we are ſure we have a God which will pardon our ſins: Though we be weak, yet when we are ready to fall, the Lord will either put under his hand and prevent us that we fall not; or if he ſuffer us to fall, yet he will raiſe us up againe; we ſhall not ſo fall as to riſe no more: In the midſt of all our infirmities, we may ſay with the Church, in <hi>Micah</hi> 7.8. <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me O mine enemy, though I fall I ſhall riſe againe.</hi> Let not Gods people bee dejected over much, to walk uncomfortably becauſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. Bee comforted againſt them by this conſolation of God; he hath made a Covenant with you, that he will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you: If it hath pleaſed him once to make you his people,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:113533:117"/> he will caſt you off no more, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. Thou that complaineſt and walkeſt heavily becauſe of thy ſinfull corruptions which burthen thee and preſſe thee down, tell me, Let me ask and let thy heart make anſwer within thee, doe thy corruptions and failings make thee leſſe to eſteeme of Chriſt, or doe they make Chriſt more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto thee? If thy corruptions get within thy heart, and make any thing more deare and precious to thee then Chriſt is, this is dangerous; but if by the ſence of thy corruption, thou art made to draw nearer unto Chriſt, to eſteem more of him, to cling faſter unto him, ſuch infirmity may ſerve to humble thee, but it ſhall never deſtroy thee: Though thou be weak, yet his Grace is ſufficient for thee, ſufficient to pardon thy failings, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient alſo to keep thee that neither gates of hell, nor ſinne, nor death ſhall ever prevaile againſt thee: Commit thy ſoule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in well-doing to thy faithfull Creator, who hath created thee anew in Chriſt Ieſus, and know that as hee is able to keep, ſo hee will keep that which is committed unto him againſt that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This may ſerve alſo for councell and direction unto all Gods faithfull ones, to take heed of ſelfe confidence and thinking to ſtand by their own ſtrength: know wherein your ſtrength lyeth; it is not in your ſelves; <hi>In his own might ſhall no man be ſtrong,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. but your ſtrength and ſafety lies in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of peace, which the Lord hath made with you; <hi>he keeps the feet of his Saints,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. <hi>he preſerves the ſoules of his Saints, Pſal.</hi> 97. &amp; 34. So as none that truſt in him ſhall periſh. It is with us as it was with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> all men wondred wherein his great ſtrength ſhould lie; but it was neither in his haire, nor in his limbs, but in the Covenant of his God; whiles hee kept his Covenant with God, God was with him, and by <hi>his</hi> power aſſiſting, and ſtrengthening, he made heaps upon heaps, and ſlew thouſands of the <hi>Philiſtimes;</hi> but when he had broken the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of his <hi>Nazar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſhip</hi> and ſo had cauſed the Lord to depart from him, then <hi>Sampſon</hi> became weak as another man; whiles we cleave to our Covenant and keep the Lord with us, then are we ſtrong and doe valiantly; but when we truſt in our ſelves and withdraw our ſelves from God who is our ſtrength, then we are weak and are overcome. There is nothing which makes a readier
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:113533:117"/> way for the falls of Gods children, then this, that they grow to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in themſelves and in that Grace which they have received: They think as <hi>Samſon,</hi> they will rouſe up and ſhake themſelves, and then they think to doe as at other times; but when the Lord ſees this diſtemper growing upon us, then he lets us take a knock or two, to heale this evill in us, and to make us know that our way to be ſtrong is to be weak; weak in our ſelves, that we may bee ſtrong in the power of his might. And indeed when we are thus weak, then are we ſtrong, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. And <hi>contrà,</hi> when we are ſtrong, then are we weak, bereft of the power of God, which is our ſtay and ſtrength. And therefore let us learn of the Prophet to ſay, <hi>In the Lord I have righteouſneſſe and ſtrength, Iſai.</hi> 45. know how unable we are of our ſelves to doe any thing, ſo much as to think a good thought 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. but are made able to do all things by the power Chriſt ſtrengthening us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. And therefore whatſoever we have to doe, look we up unto his help, to work all our works for us, whether we be to meditate, to ſpeak or to do any thing, which might bee pleaſing unto him, rely upon him for help, make him our ſtrength, as well as our redeemer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. For exhortation unto all, to labour for a ſtate in Grace, to get within this Covenant of Grace, get our ſouls indued with ſuch truth of Grace as may aſſure us of our abiding in it for ever. True Grace is of an abiding nature: It is a treaſure that will never faile; Its that part which can never be taken from us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. All the things of the world are fading and periſhing. Riches take their wings as an Eagle and flye away, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. or elſe they are made a prey and ſpoyle by the enemy, as the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> and <hi>Caldaeans</hi> did of the goods of <hi>Job.</hi> Had we <hi>Solomons</hi> Treaſures, who made ſilver as ſtones in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> yet we muſt goe naked out of the world, and take nothing away with us. But Grace is a durable and an everlaſting poſſeſſion; It never failes, if we live, it lives with us; if we die, it will not leave us nor forſake us. One graine of true ſanctifying Grace, though it be but as a graine of muſtard ſeed, is more worth then the riches and treaſures of a Kingdome; you that want it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eek it as your life; you that have it, keep it as you would keep your ſoule; Let both take heed of being deceived with ſhews and ſhadows of Grace in ſtead of truth: All is not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:113533:118"/> gold that gliſters; every one which makes a ſhew, and carries out in his profeſſion a forme of godlineſſe, hath not the truth and power of it in his heart: Theſe ſhadows will vaniſh and come to nothing; it is the ſubſtance only which remaines. Let us take heed we be not deceived; in nothing is a miſtake ſo dangerous, as in this matter in hand. Seeming ſhews and ſhadows of Grace, will end in reall miſery; whereas truth and ſoundneſſe of Grace will bring to a weight of glory.</p>
               <p>We here in theſe parts, where Religion hath a name, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſſe is diſcountenanced by all, we (I ſay) had moſt need to look to our ſelves: It is to be feared that many an one, which now makes a good profeſſion before men, yet if the ſtate of things and times ſhould change, would quickly be turned into other men. Thoſe that now ſeeme to live, and to bee for Chriſt, for Religion, for Goſpel, and for Ordinances, would then turn to be either enemies or Neuters, and ſhew themſelves to be hollow-hearted and double-minded, unſtable in the way which now they walk in: And there be divers ſorts of theſe. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some reſt in outward Reformation of groſſe ſins, they make cleane the outſide of the cup, that they may ſeeme cleane before men; but they harbour many corrupt luſts within, which they doe not ſeek to caſt forth: Into ſuch the unclean Spirit, though he ſeem to be diſpoſſed, will return again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some take up a profeſſion of Religion for carnall ends, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chriſt for loaves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.26. becomming Diſciples becauſe they look to riſe and come to preferment by Chriſt: <hi>Iudas</hi> would never have cleaved to Chriſt but that he hoped for ſome advantage by him; and what came of it in the end? when he ſaw that his hope failed him, then he falls off, and takes part with the High-Prieſt againſt Chriſt. When men doe thus take up a profeſſion of Religion for gaine, for credit, for outward reſpects in the world; a croſſe day will come which will blaſt their hopes in theſe things; God will on purpoſe croſſe the hopes of ſuch men that they might thereby be diſcovered &amp; made known. He will have both approved and not approved to be known, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and when this unlooked-for-event falls out, then as they ſee their hopes to faile them, ſo other men ſhall ſee their Religion and profeſſion to faile with them. This aſſumed body of Religion not being animated and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:113533:118"/> quickned with life, and vigour of Spirit within, will at length be laid down when they have made uſe of it for a ſeaſon to ſerve their turn.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some profeſſe the feare of God, and yet carry in them an heart eſtranged from ſuch as are moſt faithfull and upright in their walking before God, like <hi>Cain</hi> that would come and ſacrifice as well as <hi>Abel,</hi> and yet nouriſh grudge in heart againſt <hi>Abel;</hi> one Altar ſhall ſerve them both to ſacrifice on, but they have not one heart in them, nor one way to walk in. There will be a day which will declare and make manifeſt what is in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some will doe as thoſe in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.2. and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. They will come as Gods people uſe to come, as if they would ſeek after Ordinances of righteouſneſſe, and would know the way of truth; but yet when the Word toucheth their ſore, and comes to the quick to meddle with that which they have hid under their tongue, then they begin to miſlike and to murmure againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and to finde fault with him that rebuketh them: So long as the word ſpeaks pleaſing things, they like it well, but when (like ſalt) it begins to bite, then they put it from them: Such as theſe often have the word in their eares (they will heare it) and in their tongue (they will talke of it) and in their fore-heads, (make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it) and it ſhall be written on the poſts of their doors (they keeping a courſe of family duties) that all men may think the beſt of them; but it is not in their heart to love it, it is not written in the inward parts; and not being there, there is nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to maintaine the life of Grace. The oyle that ſhould feed the lamp is wanting, and therefore the light of ſuch will at length goe out, and end in darkneſſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some attaine unto great gifts in knowledge, utterance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in prayer, (&amp;c.) but withall they grow high-minded and conceited by meanes of them, and are pufft up, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more excellent then their neighbours, that they are not as other men. Theſe ſwelling walls will not ſtand long; theſe that are ſo pufft up with a fleſhly minde; the Apoſtle ſaith of them, that they hold not the head Chriſt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.18, 19. And if they hold not the head, they are but unſound members of the body; if they receive not life and quickning from the head, they will die and wither. Let us look to our ſelves, that we be none of theſe.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:113533:119"/> Theſe may be written in <hi>Jeruſalem, Iſai.</hi> 4.3. they may ſubſcribe with their hand and name themſelves by the name of <hi>Iſrael, Iſai.</hi> 44.5. but they are not written in heaven, nor ſhall they enter into the land of <hi>Iſrael, Ezeck.</hi> 13.9. Theſe want that Grace which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ſalvation: Reſt we not in theſe things, but ſeek after truth of heart, labour for that Grace which will laſt and hold out. Get an humble, meek, upright frame of Spirit; Let our hearts be knit unto Chriſt more then the rewards of Chriſt. Inſtead of that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with our own gifts, get a ſence and feeling of our own wants and weakneſſes, and come to him that hath all fulneſſe dwelling in him, that out of his fulneſſe we may receive. Such an humble, thirſting and impotent creature, ſenſible of its own unſufficiency, yet lying daily at the beautifull gate of mercy to receive ſome gift of Grace from him whoſe glory fills his temple, ſhall ſtand and continue to the end, till they receive the end of their faith and hope, the ſalvation of their ſoule; when thouſands fall at their ſide, and ten thouſands at their right hand, yet ſhall they ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, they ſhall never fall, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. This abiding Grace let us eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one labour for; ſeek it as ſilver; call, cry for it, digge deep, and ſearch for it as for Treaſures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. <hi>Bleſſed is he that findeth it, bleſſed now and bleſſed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much of the fourth benefit, and ſo alſo of all the ſpirituall bleſſings of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It followes now to ſpeak of the temporary, which concern the good things of this preſent life. Concerning which kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the Lord is not wanting in making his goodneſſe known towards his people in full meaſure. The Lord knowing how apt we are to have our minds taken up with carefull thoughts about them, and knowing alſo that we cannot (in ordinary courſe) bee without them he hath therfore made known unto us his care which he hath over us, that he will provide for us whatſoever is needfull and convenient for us, to the end that we knowing his promiſes concerning theſe things, we might by faith reſt upon his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and might be free in our minds from all vexing diſtracting cares, ſerving him chearefully in our places according to his will, looking to him for ſupply of all ſuch things as we ſtand in need of. And concerning theſe kind of bleſſings, we may obſerve how the Lord hath made us ſome <hi>generall</hi> promiſes of all good things, ſo
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:113533:119"/> as we ſhall want <hi>nothing</hi> that is good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. &amp; 84.11. The want of ſome one thing needfull, might more diſquiet us, then the poſſeſſion of many things could cheare us. And therefore he hath promiſed to give us all things: And beſides theſe generall promiſes, he hath alſo given us promiſes of many <hi>particular</hi> bleſſings; as of length of dayes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.3. &amp; 25.15. &amp; 30.20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.16. of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.1. <hi>ult. Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. of health and freedome from the diſeaſes of <hi>Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 15.26. &amp; 23.25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.15. and many other of like kinde which I paſſe by; Onely one kinde or ſort of them I mean to inſiſt upon a little; thoſe I meane, which concern our ſuſtenance and comfortable proviſion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for life; as food convenient and cloathing convenient, &amp;c. bread to eat, and clothes to put on, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. Theſe the Lord hath promiſed that he will miniſter unto his Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people; Theſe promiſes we have laid down, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.3. to 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.2. to 15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.2.3. &amp; 132.15. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.15, 16. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.30. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>I mention the <hi>more</hi> of theſe, that we ſeeing <hi>ſo many</hi> and large promiſes made unto us, we might be encouraged the rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve &amp; reſt upon the faithfulneſſe of him that hath promiſed. If the Lord ſhould have ſpoken <hi>but once</hi> unto us in the whole Scripture, concerning theſe things, we ſhould not have needed to doubt of his word. But when hee is pleaſed ſo often to repeat his promiſes over and over, againe and againe, ſo often telling us that he will not be wanting to us in theſe things, it is too much incredulity in us, if after all theſe we believe him not, and caſt not our care upon him. Eſpecially conſidering how the Lord himſelfe reckoneth theſe promiſes a part of his Covenant which he hath made with his people. Note that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.8. the Lord thy God gives thee power to get ſubſtance, <hi>to eſtabliſh his Covenant which he made with thy Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. God doth herein fulfill his Covenant with us, when he gives us ſuch ſuſtance as pertaines to the comfort of this life; and ſo in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.5, 6. &amp;c. <hi>I will cauſe the land to yeeld her encreaſe, and your threſhing ſhall reach unto the vintage,</hi> &amp;c. And why will the Lord doe this unto them? He tells them in the ninth verſe following, <hi>ſc. I will eſtabliſh my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with you,</hi> that is, <hi>I will therein performe and make good my Covenant, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 111.5. He hath given meat (or a portion) to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:113533:120"/> his people; what moves him thereto? Even his Covenant: He is ever mindfull of his Covenant; the like we have in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.25, 27. In all which we ſee how the Lord reckons this as apart of his Covenant in which he hath bound himſelfe unto his people, even to give unto them ſuch things as they ſtand in need of for this preſent life.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it is the duty of Gods people to live by faith, as well concerning thoſe things that pertaine to this preſent life, as thoſe which concern the life to come, to the end therefore that we may with more aſſured confidence reſt upon the faithfulneſſe of God in theſe things, Let us help our faith by theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Look at the fulneſſe and bounty of our God, he hath a full hand a rich treaſure, full of all good things; there is no end of his riches; he is able to make us abound unto all ſufficiency, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. and is moſt liberall and free-hearted, aboundant in goodneſſe, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, not ſparing and cloſe-handed, but ready to communicate to every one that ſtands in need.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As he is bountifull, ſo he is alſo kind and loving to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he loves the proſperity and welfare of his ſervants: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth him to ſee it go well with them; he is tender-hearted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, pittying their wants, ſenſible of their ſorrows and neceſſities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He hath already given us greater things then theſe, he hath given to us his Son, his Spirit, himſelfe; how ſhall he not then give unto us theſe leſſer things? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt hath purchaſed them for us, he hath given a full price for them; hee emptyed himſelfe, and became poore to make us rich.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our bodies are the members of Chriſt, and temples for the Spirit to dwell in, and therefore not only the love which he beares unto us, but that love which he beares unto Chriſt, may aſſure us that he will for his ſake give us that which is convenient, becauſe we are members of his body.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is not for the honour of Chriſts Kingdom that thoſe which are his ſubjects ſhould be expoſed to wants in needfull things. If he ſhould leave them deſtitute, the ſorrow might lie upon them, but the diſhonour would redound unto Chriſt, as if he ſought not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:113533:120"/> or cared not for the welfare of his people. And thence it is that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.29. &amp; 36.30. when hee promiſes unto them the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the field and ſuch other outward bleſſings, hee tells them that he will thereby take away from them the reproach of the Heathen, they ſhould henceforth beare the reproach of the Heathen no more, and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.12, 13. It is an honour which God puts upon his people in the ſight of other Nations, that hee makes them able to lend unto others, makes them the head, and others the taile &amp;c. ſets up his own above, and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.</p>
               <p n="7">7. God is in Covenant with our whole man; he is the God of our body, as well as ſoule and ſpirit; we are wholly his, he hath taken us wholly to be his own; and therefore even as our Saviour Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. doth hereby prove the reſurrection of <hi>Abrahams</hi> body, becauſe God was in Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whole <hi>Abraham,</hi> body as well as ſoule, and therefore God being the God of the living and not of the dead, <hi>Abrahams</hi> body muſt live and riſe againe; ſo by the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may gather aſſurance that God will provide for our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, becauſe he is the God of the whole man, he is a God to us, not only to pardon our ſinnes, to ſanctifie and ſave our ſoules, but he is the God of our bodies alſo, to feed and to cloth them, to miniſter to them ſuch things as are convenient for them. And hence is that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. as our body is for the Lord to ſerve and glorifie him, ſo is the Lord alſo for the body to redeem it, to nouriſh it, to glorifie it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Lord knowes how many diſcouragements we meet with here to diſhearten us in his ſervice: And therefore he caſts in theſe outward bleſſings as encouragements to provoke us to ſerve him with more willingneſſe, and cheerefulneſſe of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: As <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cauſed the <hi>Levites</hi> to have proviſion brought in unto them that they might be encouraged in the ſervice of the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.4. ſo will the Lord doe much more, hee will have his ſervants to know, that they ſhall not ſerve him for nought, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. not ſo much as to ſhut a doore in his houſe in vaine, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Lord hath commanded ſuch duties unto his ſervants as they cannot performe without a ſupply in theſe outward things,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:113533:121"/> works of love, mercy, kindneſſe, helpfulneſſe one to another; yea, he would have us to abound in theſe things, and (as examples) to goe before all other people. And therefore he will alſo furniſh us with ſufficiency, that we may be compleat unto every good work. He will not ſend on a meſſage and cut off the feet of him whom he ſends, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.6.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Lord looks for ſervice from our outward man, <hi>give up your body as an holy living Sacrifice unto God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. <hi>Glorifie God in your bodies and ſpirits, for they are God's,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. but he will not reap where he hath not ſown, nor look to gather where he hath not ſcattered; he will ſuſtaine us, if he look for ſervice from us.</p>
               <p n="11">11. We are Gods houſhold and family, and therefore hee will provide for his own: If he have charged us to provide for our own, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. he will not he cannot be wanting to his: If he feed the Ravens, <hi>Job.</hi> 39.3. and cloath the Lilies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26. he will not ſuffer his children to want bread.</p>
               <p n="12">12. By giving us theſe outward things, the Lord would nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh our faith in the hope of things ſpirituall and heavenly; for when we ſee his care over us in theſe leſſer things, it may aſſure us, that he will not neglect us in thoſe that are of greater moment. The outward bleſſings which God gave unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings alone, but pledges and tokens of better things; he gave them bread from heaven, and it was an outward bodily food, but not that only; but it was a pledge to them of the true bread from heaven; he gave them water out of the Rock, which did quench their bodily thirſt, but not that only, but was a ſign and pledge of Chriſt the true Rock, out of whom ſprings the water of life; he gave them a good and fat land to dwell in, where they had vine-yards, orchards, gardens, and lived in pleaſure therein through his great goodneſſe, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. but not as an outward bleſſing only, but as a pledge of a better inheritance: And thus doth he unto us; though every thing is not now typicall to us, as to them, yet thus far we may go, to ſay that theſe outward bleſſings are made pledges unto us of Gods love towards us in better things, ſo as we may argue from the leſſe to the greater, that if he be ſo mindfull of us in theſe ſmaller things of this life, then doubtleſſe he will not neglect us in thoſe greater things which concerne the eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our ſoules.</p>

                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:113533:121"/>13. He knowes we have need of theſe things <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.32. and therefore he having commanded us to give unto him that needeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.28. and open our hand wide unto the poore, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.11. ſurely he will not ſhut up the bowels of his compaſſion from his own needy ſervants, but will open his good treaſure unto them, to ſatisfie them with good things, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſometimes wee ſee Gods faithfull ſervants to bee kept ſhort in theſe outward bleſſings; how comes this to paſſe, the Lord having made ſuch ample promiſes unto them? and how farre forth may any bee aſſured to have a ſufficiency in theſe things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt I conceive thus: Firſt, all the promiſes of things pertaining to this life are ſubordinate and ſubſervient to the promiſes which concern our inward man, and our eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: God doth not promiſe us theſe outward things, ſo as to make againſt our ſpirituall good, but ſo as to further and help it forward: he promiſeth them with Chriſt, not againſt Chriſt, nor to hinder his Kingdome in our hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. If it ſo fall out, that ſufficiency in theſe may better us in the inward man, wee ſhall not want them; but becauſe the Lord ſees us ſometimes to abuſe them to the fulfilling of our wanton deſires, to pride, ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, confidence, and truſting in them; here the Lord is free from his promiſe, leaſt by filling us with thoſe things that are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he ſhould empty us of that little grace that is in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there are times of tryall, in which the Lord will try all his children, <hi>The Lord will try the righteous,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.5. thus he tryed them in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36, 37. they were tryed with mockings and ſcourgings, being deſtitute, afflicted and tormented: Thus alſo he tryed <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2, 16. and thus he tryed holy <hi>Job;</hi> God will know what is in us; he will ſee whether we ſerve him for wages, yea, or no; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee would continue to ſerve him out of love, though he ſhould give us nothing. Hee will ſee whether we follow him for loaves, or whether we can be content to cleave to him in wants and neceſſities, having nothing. But though the Lord will thus try us, yet theſe times of tryall laſt not alwayes, theſe are not the wayes of Gods ordinary diſpenſation towards his people: During theſe times of tryall, the Lord doth ſometimes cut ſhort his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:113533:122"/> in outward things, but it is to do them good in the later end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. The hardſhips which <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuffered for awhile in the wilderneſſe, was recompenced with a Land flowing with milke and honey.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſometimes God withholds good things from us for a chaſtiſement of our ſinne; according to that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. <hi>your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have hindred good things from you;</hi> when wee goe out of the way in which the bleſſing falls, its no marvell if it fall beſide us; In theſe caſes when either by ſin we turn aſide from the path of righteouſneſſe, or if the Lord will take a time to try our uprightneſſe before him, or if he ſee our enjoying of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings would be an hinderance to our ſpirituall good, in theſe caſes (I ſay) Gods children may be exerciſed with wants and neceſſities, and yet the promiſe of God failes not; not in the firſt caſe, becauſe the promiſe of outward things in the making of it, is ſubſervient to the ſpirituall good of our inward man; nor in the ſecond caſe, becauſe the Lord hath put an exception of tryall, by which he will try all his: Nor in the third caſe, becauſe theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things are promiſed as rewards of Grace, whereby the Lord doth recompence the love and obedience of his people.</p>
               <p>But to the third part of the demand, if it be further queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned how farre forth a childe of God (out of theſe caſes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named) may aſſure himſelfe of the fulfilling of theſe promiſes unto him: hereunto I anſwer thus: Wee muſt conſider two things; firſt, what is promiſed; ſecondly, how and in what manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, conſider what is promiſed; for here may be a miſtake, in taking the promiſe to containe more then indeed it doth; when the Lord promiſeth, that riches and treaſure ſhall be in the houſe of the righteous, what doth he meane by riches and treaſure? not the riches of a Kingdome; or that which ſhall be ſufficient for a man of high degree; but ſuch a ſufficiency as is ſutable to every ones eſtate and condition which God hath ſet them in: That which is want and poverty to one, may be fulneſſe and abundance to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: That then is riches to any man, when God gives him ſo much as is ſufficiently enough for him in his eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though he may ſtill come ſhort of many others of higher ranke; this is that which is promiſed.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:113533:122"/>
               <p>Secondly, conſider in what manner God promiſeth theſe things, and that is (as was ſaid before) as rewards and as fruits of that faith and obedience which he requires of his people; <hi>Dwell in the land and doe good, and thou ſhalt be fed aſſuredly,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3. But what is this good that we muſt doe? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In generall. Be upright with God in our converſation before him; 2. Walk diligently and faithfully in our particular callings, be not ſlothfull and unprofitable unto our ſelves: It is the diligent hand that hath the promiſe of abundance, <hi>The talk of the lips brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but want, Prov.</hi> 10. 3. And then we muſt depend upon God by faith in the uſe of meanes, not truſting either to our own uprightneſſe, or to the meanes uſed, but reſt by faith on the grace of the promiſe, as knowing that when we have done all that wee can, both in our generall and particular calling, yet the Lord might juſtly blaſt all our endeavours, ſo as all our labour and ſtrength might be ſpent in vaine: Here therefore our confidence muſt be pitcht, not upon our ſelves, nor meanes, but look by faith to the bleſſing promiſed, which bleſſing is all in all. Believe and yee ſhall proſper, ſaid <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.20. and <hi>contra,</hi> if yee believe not, <hi>yee ſhall not be eſtabliſhed,</hi> ſaid <hi>Iſaiah, Iſai.</hi> 7.9. There is much in the faith of Gods people: Its a ſpeciall meanes to obtaine the bleſſing: It was uſuall with Chriſt, when any came unto him for help in outward things, to ask them whether they believed or no; and then he would tell them, according to your faith be it unto you; All Gods bleſſings are wrapt within his promiſes: And faith is the hand to receive all, whether they be ſpirituall bleſſings, or outward concerning this life: whatſoever the bleſſings be, if they ſpring from Grace, they muſt be received by faith. The hand of Grace gives them, and the hand of faith receives them: And ſometimes the want of faith onely, cuts us ſhort of the bleſſing we might enjoy; we proſper not, becauſe we believe not: The ſumme is this: Let a man walk uprightly before God in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall calling; Let him be provident and diligent in his particular calling; Let him withall in both theſe look by faith to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the promiſe of God, believing that in this way he will give that which is ſufficient for him, Then I ſay, that in the ordinary courſe of Gods dealing, hee may be ſure the Lord will not be wanting to him, in ſuch things as his ſtate and condition doth require.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Concerning wicked men, this may let us ſee that they have no true right before God, unto the good things of this life: I ſpeak not of right before men, but before God; for if they have, I ask by what Covenant? Is it by the Covenant of works? then they muſt fulfill it, which they doe not, nor can doe; is it then by the Covenant of Grace? but they are not within that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: They are within the Covenant of works, but cannot fulfill it; they are without the Covenant of Grace, and therefore they can claime nothing by it. But they ſay, there is <hi>debitum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae;</hi> nature may claime ſo much as tends to the upholding of naturall life and being. But I ſay again, what claime can they have to life, or to any thing which concernes life, which have deſerved to be deſtroyed and brought to nothing? for ought I can ſee the old opinion herein muſt ſtand as truth, that wicked men are but uſurpers of the things they doe enjoy. And if Chriſt bee the Heire of all things, and we come to our right to them onely by Chriſt, then thoſe that are not Chriſts have no right unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas ſome weak ones doe think they ſhould pray only for ſpirituall bleſſings and not for outward things of this life, they may hence ſee their errour: They may lawfully pray for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; look what God doth promiſe, we may lawfully pray for; but God doth promiſe to us theſe outward things, therefore we may pray for them; Chriſt alſo hath taught us the ſame, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. and its our duty to doe it, thereby to teſtifie our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon God our heavenly Father, for the ſupply of all
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:113533:123"/> our neceſſities, and in ſo doing wee give glory to God, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that every good gift muſt come from him, <hi>James</hi> 1.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas ſome of Gods ſervants are poſſeſſed with doubts concerning their eſtate before God, as fearing that they are not the Lords people, becauſe they are ſuffered to proſper ſo much in outward things, this point may ſerve to remove that ſcruple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe outward bleſſings are bleſſings of grace to the people of God, and therefore may well ſtand with a gracious eſtate. If we endeavour to walk before God in truth and uprightneſſe, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to keep a pure conſcience in all things towards God and man, then for any one to ſay, I feare I am none of Gods people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I proſper in the world, is all one as if he ſhould ſay, I feare the Lord intends me no good, becauſe he makes good unto me the bleſſings which he hath promiſed in his Covenant.</p>

               <p n="1">I. As for the cauſe of our wants, what ſhall we ſay? is God unfaithfull? doth his promiſe faile? is he unmindfull of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? if not, then think what is the cauſe of theſe wants which lie upon us; &amp;c. In <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7. when <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſaw the people flie before their enemies (which ſeemed contrary to the promiſe of God, the Lord having before promiſed to <hi>Joſhuah</hi> that not a man ſhould ſtand before him all the dayes of his life) <hi>Joſhuah</hi> falls on his face before God, and begins to expoſtulate with him why he had brought them thither to deſtroy them; But mark the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Get thee up ſaith the Lord to</hi> Ioſhuah, <hi>why lyest thou upon thy face?</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath ſinned, and therefore they cannot ſtand before their enemies: Ioſhuah</hi> not knowing, nor conſidering the ſinne of the people; hee wonders at their overthrow as if the Lord had not been mindfull of his promiſe, he having promiſed that not a man ſhould be able to ſtand before them: But the Lord tells <hi>Ioſhuah, Nay (ſaith the Lord) It is not I that have failed in my Covenant towards you, but you have bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:113533:124"/> ſinned and tranſgreſſed my Covenant, and therefore it is that they cannot ſtand before their enemies.</hi> So we, when we feele our ſelves preſſed with wants and neceſſities, we are apt to think that Gods falls ſhort of his promiſe towards us. He hath promiſed ſufficiency of all good things to his ſervants, but we ſee not his promiſe made good unto us, we ſuffer wants: And now we are ready to aske, why hath the Lord brought us hither into this wilderneſſe, to deſtroy us? But let us know, it is not the Lord which hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken promiſe with us, but we have ſinned and broken Covenant with him. There is amongſt us an accurſed thing, which till it be caſt out of the campe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we ſhall not ſtand before our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, but they will prevaile againſt us, as an armed man. They are our iniquities which have turned away theſe things, and our ſins have hindred good things from us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. Our own wayes and doings have procured theſe things unto us; we may thank our ſelves, if we be cut ſhort in the things we would have: Let God be true, and every man a lyar; Let him be acknowledged faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his promiſe, but we have dealt treacherouſly againſt him; we have ſinned, and there is the true cauſe of our miſery.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have amongſt us <hi>Achans</hi> ſinne; I ſaw, and coveted, ſaith he; we have amongſt us worldlineſſe and coveteouſneſſe, which hath ſeiſed upon us and hath eaten up our hearts. The ruſt hereof hath conſumed the good that was in us; we pretended to come hither for ordinances, but now ordinances are light matters with us, and we are turned after the prey. Had any other people that profeſſed themſelves to be <hi>of</hi> the world, and <hi>for</hi> the world, had they thus walked, the Lord would have ſaid of them, they are gone thither for the worlds goods, and let them take their fill of it, let them have what they goe for: But as for us, the Lord will not ſuffer us ſo: If he ſee us forſaking the ſubſtance, the true treaſure, to runne after theſe ſhadows, they ſhall flie from us the more that we purſue them, till we turn againe unto the Lord, and then though we follow not them, yet they ſhall follow us, and ſhall purſue us and overtake us, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.2. As now we are preſſed with wants, ſo then we ſhall be laden with benefits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have amongſt us exceſſe and pride of life; pride in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, daintineſs in dyet, and that in thoſe who in times paſt would
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:113533:124"/> have been glad to have been ſatisfied with bread; this is the ſinne of the loweſt of our people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another ſort are idle and walk inordinately, not labouring at all, but live unprofitably, going from houſe to houſe: They cannot put their hand to works.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We have abundance of oppreſſion and injuſtice in our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, with breach of Covenants and promiſes; there is want of truth and juſtice, it is almoſt departed from our ſtreets. The Lord may now complaine of us, as ſometimes he did before of <hi>Iſrael, I looked for judgement, but behold oppreſſion; for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but behold a crying, Iſai.</hi> 5.7. and this ſin will make a fire which is not blown (by man) to kindle of it ſelfe to conſume us, <hi>Job</hi> 20.19, 26.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By theſe our ſinnes, we have brought a reproach upon the Goſpel, the glorious Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which ſhould have been glorified by us. So long as the Goſpel held its credit amongſt us, ſo long the Lord alſo manifeſted his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous goodneſſe towards us, upholding us alſo and keeping us from thoſe wants which now we feele; But when the credit of the Goſpel began to ſuffer by us, we began to ſuffer with it alſo; receiving therein a juſt recompence of our evill as was meet.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is amongſt us a ſtraight-heartedneſſe, and cloſe-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe towards the Lord; in not miniſtring to the things which concern his worſhip; the leaſt portion is enough, and the worſt is good enough, for thoſe things that concern his honour: This is a ſinne which the Lord hath ever been wont to puniſh with ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as we may ſee in <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>Achans</hi> which have robbed us of our ſilver and gold, theſe ſinnes have ſpoyled us of our ſubſtance; and where the e things are found, it is no marvell though we complaine of wants; yet not through breach of Covenant on the Lords part, but through our ſinfull breaking with him; <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath ſinned, wee have ſinned, and therefore it is that we are fallen, and come down ſo low.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Are we in want and doe we deſire to enjoy a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of theſe outward bleſſings? would we be ſet in a way in which wee may be ſure to be provided for? we have the way
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:113533:125"/> here ſet before us; we heare that theſe bleſſings are promiſed in Gods Covenant: The promiſing of them is one branch of that Covenant which the Lord makes with his people: The way then is this: Firſt, to enter into a Covenant with God, and then to walk in Covenant with him, as becomes his people: 1. Enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him. Art thou in hunger, nakedneſſe, or (if not in ſuch extremities, yet) wanteſt thou thoſe things which thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtands in need of? It may be thou art a ſtranger to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt God and his people, and haſt lived an alien from God. Thou haſt with the Prodigall forſaken thy Fathers houſe, departed away from God, living viciouſly and ſinfully, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord hath brought thee to the ſame condition as the Prodigall was brought unto in theſe thy neceſſities; doe thou then as the Prodigall did, when he was in neceſſity, and knew not what to doe, he then bethinks himſelfe; In my Fathers houſe (ſaith he) there is bread enough, but I am ready to periſh for hunger; I will therefore ariſe and goe to my Father and humble my ſelfe unto him, deſiring to be as one of his hired ſervants. Think with thy ſelfe what proviſion the Lord makes for thoſe that are of his houſhold; his children and ſervants have bread enough. Ariſe therefore out of thy ſin by repentance, goe unto him and ſue to be taken into his family, and to be one of his ſervants; and then will the Father call for roabs to cover thy nakedneſſe, and bring out the fatted calfe to ſatisfie thy hunger, thou ſhalt be fed with food convenient for thee: Thy bread ſhall not faile, and thy water ſhall be ſure: Though he ſuffer aliens to want, yet his family ſhall bee provided for; but then remember this withall, to walk in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; walk as becomes one of the family of heaven, and of the houſhold of God; be faithfull and diligent in his ſervice, have a care of his honour; doe nothing to blemiſh his name, bee carefull to pleaſe him in all things; be zealous for his glory: Be thankfull that he hath taken thee to bee one of his: Be faithfull in thy particular calling, as therein ſerving the Lord, and not to ſerve thine own turn. Study to bee uſefull and ſerviceable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Gods ſervants, which are of the ſame houſhold of faith with thee, and in this way of the Covenant, look for, and expect the bleſſing of it; <hi>Doe good</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>and thou ſhalt be fed aſſuredly, Pſal.</hi> 37.3. <hi>If yee be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:113533:125"/> the good things of the land, Iſai.</hi> 1.19. and if at any time thou be put to ſtraights and wants, doe as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, put God in minde of his Covenant and promiſe: <hi>Lord thou ſaidſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jacob) that thou wouldeſt doe me good:</hi> Lord (ſay thou) thou haſt ſaid thou wilt care for me, and provide things needfull for thy ſervants, and therefore though I be not worthy of the leaſt of all thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, not worthy to be fed with the crums which fall from thy childrens table, yet becauſe thou haſt ſaid that thou wilt ſatiate thy people with thy goodneſſe, make good thy word which thou haſt ſpoken; Let thy mercy come, unto me, as I truſt in thee. Thus doe and then lay thy life upon it, thou ſhalt not want: Bread ſhall be given thee, and thy waters ſhall not faile; thou ſhalt have thy daily portion provided for thee. Though thou haſt not much laid up in ſtore for many yeares or dayes, yet thou ſhalt have thine Omer day by day. And as thoſe in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 11.23. &amp; 12.47. they had by the Kings appointment every day a ſet portion, ſo ſhalt thou have thy daily allowance, daily bread, with all ſuch other things as concern this preſent life.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As in the want, ſo in the enjoyment of outward good things, the former conſideration gives us direction alſo; doe we enjoy them? hath God made good his promiſe unto us? have we a portion convenient for us? Then</p>
               <p n="1">1. Learn hereby to acknowledge God in theſe gifts of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and grace towards us; ſee his hand in them, and know that it is he that gives us all things to enjoy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18. ſay not it is our own hand that hath done this. Though theſe outward things be but the bleſſings of the left hand, the leſſer bleſſings of the Covenant, yet the Lord would be acknowledged even in theſe. This is one reaſon why the Lord promiſeth theſe things to us in his Covenant, that we might learn thereby to acknowledge that they come not unto us by chance or fortune as Heathens thought, calling them therefore <hi>Bona Fortunae,</hi> nor yet as carnall Chriſtians think, by our own providence or wiſedome, but look at them as bleſſings comming from the Lord himſelfe. This leſſon the Lord teacheth us <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.17, 18. <hi>Say not it is mine own hand which hath prepared me this abundance, but it is the Lord which gives thee power to get ſubſtance, &amp;c.</hi> and when we are wanting in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his hand in them, the Lord complaines of our neglect,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:113533:126"/> as we may ſee in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>ſhee did not know that I gave her her corne, and wine, and oyle, and multiplyed her ſilver and gold, &amp;c.</hi> And thence it is (as I think, though others interpret the place otherwiſe) that in <hi>Iob</hi> 31.27. where <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks of his great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and riches; hee ſaith his mouth did not kiſſe his hand: That is, he did not applaud himſelfe, nor did he aſcribe it to his own handy works. Some other would have ſaid, this hand hath done it, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10.13. which had been a kiſſing of his hand and an honouring of himſelfe, and not a giving glory to God. But <hi>Job</hi> abhorred this; ſo ſhould we; let us in our heart acknowledge that it is not our own hand, but the Lord which hath given us all our abundance of good things: In them ſee his bounty towards us. As he hath let the ſtreame of his bounty run forth towards us, ſo ſhould wee run back, and acknowledge the bountifulneſſe of the Lord <hi>for the wheat and for the wine which he hath given us, Ier.</hi> 31.12. Should God withhold his hand, we might labour long enough, and put all our gettings into a broken bag, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. The race is not alwayes to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, nor riches to men of underſtanding, and of ſtrength, but the Lord gives to every one as pleaſeth him. And as we ſhould ſee Gods bounty towards us in theſe, ſo wee ſhould ſee his Grace alſo in them. Look at them as bleſſings of Grace; which are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to us by the Covenant of Grace which he hath made with us in Chriſt. They are not ſo unto the wicked, who are not in Covenant with the Lord, but to the Saints they are, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.5. when <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpeaks of his children, <hi>theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which God of his Grace hath given thy ſervant: Iacob</hi> ſaw Grace in this; ſo ſhould we ſee Grace in every outward bleſſing wee enjoy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But theſe outward bleſſings are common to good and bad, and no man can know love or hatred by theſe things which are before him; how then may I know that God gives me theſe things out of Grace and love?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If we come by them in the way of the Covenant, we walking before God in the way of holy obedience and dependance upon him, Its certain they doe then come to us as bleſſings, and are given us by vertue of his Covenant: And therefore it is that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.1, 2, 8, 12. <hi>If thou ſhalt diligently obſerve the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:113533:126"/> of the Lord thy God,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) then ſhall he command the bleſſing to come upon thee, and all theſe bleſſings ſhall overtake thee, &amp;c.</hi> he doth not ſay, thus ſhall thou be enriched, thus ſhalt thou encreaſe in goods, &amp;c. but thus ſhall the Lord <hi>bleſſe</hi> thee, and <hi>theſe bleſſings</hi> ſhall come upon thee, to note unto us, that when we walk with God in this way of obedience conſcionably, then what ever good things come unto us, they come as a bleſſing: The Lord not only gives the bleſſing it ſelfe, but hee gives it as a bleſſing, and a bleſſing of Grace comming through his Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they be as bands and cords of love betwixt God and us; as bands to draw us nearer unto him, and as cords to tie us faſter unto him, cauſing us to love him more, and to honour him in the uſe of thoſe good things which we have received from him, doubtleſſe they doe then come from his Grace towards us, and are bleſſings of the Covenant. <hi>I have loved thee</hi> (ſaith the Lord) in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>and with mercy have I drawn thee;</hi> If God draw us unto him by any meanes, there is mercy in it, and there is a bleſſing in it. Take this as a rule for ever, what ever brings us to God is a bleſſing; as contrariwiſe whatever ſeparates us from God is a curſe. And that which cauſeth love, comes from love. If theſe things work love in our hearts towards God, then doe they come from his love towards us. Conſider then, are our hearts carried away from God by the things we enjoy? this is dangerous: But are our hearts thereby more drawn and knit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? then own them as bleſſings of the Covenant, as ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the fountaine of Grace which God hath opened to us in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seeing theſe outward good things are given to Gods people by Covenant, as bleſſings, and as ſpringing from Grace, this muſt teach us to be content with ſuch a meaſure of them as our Father ſeeth meeteſt for us; though we have leſſe in outward things, yet there is the ſame grace in that little, as if we had an hundred fold. Sometimes there is much love ſeen in a little thing; and ſo it is in theſe gifts which God gives to his children: The gift may be ſmall, but the love is great from which it comes: This love ſhould ſatisfie, whether the gift we receive from it, be leſſe or more: As a younger childe which his Father loves
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:113533:127"/> tenderly, though he have not ſo large allowance, and liberall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as his elder brother that is grown to yeares, yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts himſelfe in this, he ſaith in his heart, I know my Father loves me as well as any childe he hath, and thus ſatisfies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his Fathers love, though his yearely allowance bee not equall with ſome other; ſo ſhould we: Though we have not ſo much wheat and wine and oyle, &amp;c. yet we may ſatiate our ſoule with the Lords goodneſſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.12, 14. that goodneſſe of his being the ſame towards us in our little, as if our portion were much more abundant. And this contentation we ſhould the rather labour for, becauſe if we be not ſatisfied with that leſſer portion which the Lord beſtows upon us, untill we abound, it is ſuſpicious, and we have cauſe to doubt, whether our contentment be not more in the gift then in the grace and love of the Giver; For if it be his love that ſatisfies us, why are we not ſatisfied when we have leſſe, as if we had more? if we have food and rayment (having them from the gift of his Grace) let us therewith bee content. Satisfie us with thy mercy ſaith <hi>Moſes, Pſal.</hi> 90.14. <hi>Moſes</hi> could be ſatisfied with mercy, though he had but little elſe; there is a ſatisfying ſufficiency in it, if wee can but ſee it, and relliſh it in the things we enjoy: Let us make ſure of this, that what we have, it may come from the hand of Grace, and then let us be contented with it, be it leſſe or more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth the Lord thus provide for his ſervants in theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things? let us then ſerve him with our outward man. Hee bleſſeth us with all kinde of bleſſings, in ſpirituall things pertaining to our inward man, and in outward things pertaining to our outward man to the end that we might ſerve him and glorifie him in both; he feeds and cloaths our bodies, he maintaines the health and ſtrength of them; therefore give them up as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſacrifice unto him, <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This ſame conſideration before named, may teach us how to uſe the good things of this life which we doe enjoy: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Doe we receive them from Grace? doe not then abuſe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:113533:127"/> them unto ſinne, to pride, wantonneſſe, exceſſe, &amp;c. This is to turn the Grace of God (ſhewed in giving of them to us) into licentiouſneſſe. In <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.8. the Lord complaines there, that when he had given them corne and wine, ſilver and gold, they beſtowed them upon <hi>Baal,</hi> abuſing them to Idolatry and to ſinne: And its noted as the ſinne of wicked <hi>Athaliah,</hi> that the dedicate things which ſhould have been to the honouring of God, theſe ſhee beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Baalim;</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.7. When we thus abuſe his bleſſings unto ſinne, we turne that againſt God, which we have received from him for good. And in ſo doing we may juſtly feare, leaſt they become teſtimonies againſt us, in the day of our account: Therefore do not ſo requite the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. Remember from what hand wee have received them, and take heed we abuſe them not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence learn to return part of our ſubſtance unto God; Give up that unto him, which we have received from him. The Lord gives us leave to eat and to drink, and to cheere our hearts by partaking in the portion we enjoy under the ſame; wee may take the comfort of what hee hath given us and make uſe of it for our own good: But he never allowed us to keep all unto our ſelves, but commands us to diſtribute them as good Stewards, one part to the reliefe of his poore Saints, another part for the benefit of the Common-Wealth, either in peace or warre, as occaſions require, and part alſo for the upholding of his worſhip and ſervice, and the good of his Church. Thus <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. <hi>honour God with thy riches, and with the firſt fruit of all thine encreaſe.</hi> He doth not ſay honour <hi>thy ſelfe</hi> with thy riches, but honour <hi>God</hi> with them; as they come from his Grace, ſo they ſhould be uſed to his glory. All things are of him and for him: when <hi>we</hi> are in any need, the Lord fulfils all our neceſſities, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. So when the Lord ſtands in need of any thing, we muſt let goe that which he ſtands in need of, according to that of our bleſſed Saviour, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.3. <hi>Tell them the Lord hath need of him, and then ſtraight way they will let him goe;</hi> we doe willingly receive from God, and we ſhould as willingly give back unto God; wee are ready

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, whether wee want or whether we abound, let this teach us to depend upon the faithfulneſſe of Gods Covenant, either for the ſupply of theſe outward things if wee want them, or for the continuance and maintenance of that portion which he hath given us; we have his promiſe; believe it, reſt upon it, and though all things may ſeeme to make againſt us, yet his promiſe will hold, it cannot faile.

His name would ſuffer in our ſuffrings and wants, if he ſhould then forſake us, when wee walk before him in faith and obedience, according to his will; yea, though we for our parts have deſerved to be forſaken by reaſon of our great departings away from him, <hi>yet if we return unto him with all our ſoul, he will not forſake us, for his own great names ſake, becauſe it hath pleaſed him to make us his people,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. Therefore caſt we our care upon the Lord and he will care for us; and though we ſee our wants encreaſing upon us, yet remember the earth is the Lords and the fulneſſe of it; he hath an hid treaſure that we know not of; he fed <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>Manna,</hi> which neither they nor their Fathers knew, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. And he will finde out ſuch wayes for our ſupply, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their we nor our Fathers before us ever knew of; only believe and be obedient to his word, and then let not our hearts bee
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:113533:128"/> troubled nor feare, the Lord will rather make the Rocks to flow forth with honey, and the clouds to drop down milk, and the graſſe of the wilderneſſe to become as wooll to provide us cloathing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we ſhall want thoſe things which we ſtand in need of. This word is a ſure word, a faithfull ſaying, <hi>The Lord will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his people;</hi> and what he hath ſpoken concerning all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, he ſpeaks to every one in particular, <hi>I will not faile Thee, nor forſake Thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what promiſes the Lord makes unto us, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits he conveyes by his Covenant both ſpirituall and temporary; for the inward and outward man; all which are communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in this life. But beſides theſe forenamed benefits, there are greater things to come, which the Lord hath promiſed, and will make good to his Covenanted people. And theſe things which are to come, are the great benefits of the Covenant; theſe which we now enjoy in this life preſent, are ſweet and precious, yea, and great alſo if compared with the things of this world: But if we compare them with the things to come, then are they but as the firſt fruits to the rich harveſt, the whole crop. The beſt part of that which God hath promiſed us in his Covenant, it is to be waited for by hope, it is laid up, it is reſerved for us, to be revealed in the laſt times, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. They are within the vaile, whither our eye cannot pierce, to ſee and ſay what they are; they are things which (in the fulneſſe of them) can neither be uttered by tongue, nor can heart conceive them. Neither doth the world know, no nor Gods people themſelves do not know the things which are prepared for them. Its a ſweet gradation which the Apoſtle hath in that ſpeech of his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. where he ſaith, <hi>That neither eye hath ſeen, nor eare heard, nor did they enter into the heart of man, &amp;c.</hi> Did never eye ſee ſuch things? Many men have ſeene ſtrange things; A man may ſee all the excellency and glory the world hath, though he poſſeſſe it not. But though a man may ſee much, yet he may heare more by the hearing of the eare, then ever his eye ſaw; And yet more, when he hath ſeen and heard all that can be ſeene or uttered, yet his heart may conceive greater things then all theſe; But here is the ſurpaſſing excellency of the things to come, which God hath prepared for his people, that neither eye hath ſeene them, no nor yet did ever eare
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:113533:129"/> heare of them, no nor can they be conceived by the heart of man; they are above all that ever was ſeen, heard or thought; we are now ſons, heirs, but it is only in hope <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7. but though our portion be by hope to be waited for, yet it is a bleſſed hope, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. which when it comes to be enjoyed in preſent poſſeſſion, will be ſound to be above all that we heard, conceived, or could have hoped for. There is life (to die no more) there is glory (no more ſhame nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt) there is pleaſure (no more ſighing or ſorrowing) there is life, and that in abundance, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>Glory and that ſurpaſsing the glory of the Sunne,</hi> Matth. 13.43. <hi>pleaſure and that in all fulneſſe. And all theſe not for a little ſeaſon, but for evermore, Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> Whiles we are here we enjoy life, here is glory alſo in a degree, and here are pleaſures too, but here they are not full; there is ſome death mixed with our life, ſome baſeneſſe with our glory, ſome ſorrowes with our pleaſures. And though they were full, which they are not; yet they laſt but for a time. But there, and then, they ſhall be full and for evermore; I cannot paſſe by that admirable expreſſion of the Apoſtle, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. where ſpeaking of the bleſſed eſtate of Gods people in the life to come, he calls it a farre more excellent eternall weight of glory: 1. There is glory: 2. A weight of glory, as much as we are able to beare: 3. There is an excellency in it, and excellent weight of glory: 4. There is one excellency added to another, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a moſt excellent glory: 5. and laſtly, all this eternall, a moſt excellent eternall weight of glory; here is a large expreſſion in few words. This is the hope of Gods people which they wait for; And for this they have Gods faithfull word and promiſe, his Covenant and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and for our aſſurance he hath already given us the earneſt of it in our hearts, even the Spirit of Grace and the Spirit of glory, which by guiding of us in the wayes of Grace here, leads us on day by day, to come nearer to our ſalvation then when we firſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, till at laſt he bring us to glory, even to the full end of our faith and hope, the ſalvation of our ſoules.</p>

               <p>Great are the bleſſings which God hath promiſed to thoſe which are the faithfull ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and therefore as we deſire to enjoy the bleſſing promiſed, ſo we muſt ſee alſo what he requires of us, that he may performe unto us what he hath promiſed,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:113533:130"/> and this is called the ſtipulation or condition of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And concerning this I will ſhew theſe foure things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is a condition required.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why the Lord hath put a condition to the promiſe of life.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Whether the putting of ſuch a condition doth or can ſtand with the free Grace of the Covenant, yea or no.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there is a condition of the Covenant: The Lord doth not abſolutely promiſe life unto any; he doth not ſay to any ſoule, I will ſave you and bring you to life, though you continew impenitent and unbelieving, but commands and works us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, and then promiſes that in the way of faith and repentance, he will ſave us. He preſcribes a way of life for us to walk in, that ſo wee may obtaine the ſalvation which he hath promiſed; he brings us firſt through the doore of faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. And then carries us on in the way of faith, till he bring us to the end of our faith the ſalvation of our ſoules.</p>
               <p>There are indeed ſome promiſes which <hi>ſeeme</hi> ſo abſolute as to exclude all condition on our part, as that promiſe in <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.25. <hi>For mine own ſake will I put away thy tranſgreſſions, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.22. Where there is no mention made either of faith or any other Grace in us, as a condition required on our part. But if any ſhall hence argue that the promiſe of life is ſo abſolute as to exclude all reſpect unto faith in thoſe to whom the promiſe is made, and becauſe there is no mention made of faith in ſuch promiſes, therefore there is no intendment of it, as if it were not underſtood, but wholly excluded, I may as well argue againſt the merits of Chriſt alſo, and exclude them by the like reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no mention of them, no more then of faith in thoſe abſolute promiſes. But as there is no remiſſion without the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. So neither is there without faith in that blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. as God never promiſed to forgive us our ſins without reſpect to Chriſt, though Chriſt be not alwayes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in every ſuch promiſe, ſo neither doth he promiſe to ſave without faith, though it be not alwayes mentioned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
               <p>To prove that there is a condition in the Covenant of Grace, it may be made evident ſundry wayes.</p>

                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:113533:130"/>1.

Where the Lord ſpeaking of his purpoſe and promiſe never to deſtroy the earth any more, he calls that promiſe his Covenant, though there be no condition there annexed: But the Queſtion is not how a word may be uſed upon ſome ſpeciall occaſion; but what is the proper nature of a Covenant, which doth require mutuall ſtipulation or condition on both parties; This is but one place where the word Covenant is taken for a promiſe without a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; more ſuch places I know not any in Scripture; and beſides there was ſpeciall reaſon of calling it a Covenant; namely, to ſhew the unchangeableneſſe of his purpoſe touching the mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that it is as ſure as if we had tyed him thereunto by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, upon ſome condition performed by us before hand: But this is not properly a Covenant, where there is not a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall obligation and binding of the parties one to another by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Hereto agreeth that ſaying of <hi>Beza,</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua est (inquit) depoſiti obligatio inter Deum &amp; Sanctos ipſius;</hi> Though on Gods part this obligation is <hi>prorſus gratuita,</hi> wholly free, as hee there ſpeaks; though Gods binding of himſelfe to us bee free, yet ours is not ſo to God: But concerning the freeneſſe of the Covenant, we ſhall ſpeak hereafter; thus much only for the preſent he affirmes that there is <hi>mutua obligatio,</hi> a mutuall bond or tie, by which God binds us to himſelfe, as well as he binds himſelfe to us, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But for further confirmation hereof, conſider the different kinds of expreſſions which the Scripture uſeth in ſpeaking of the Covenant betwixt God and us: There is mention made of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>promiſed;</hi> And there is mention alſo of a Covenant
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:113533:131"/> 
                  <hi>commanded,</hi> not to imply two Covenants, but two parts of the ſame Covenant; one part of it ſtanding in the promiſe from God to us, the other, in duty from us to God: Thus <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12. there is the Covenant which God promiſed and by oath ſwore unto his people; and then in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.11. there is the Covenant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which is the condition on our part required; take away the condition, you muſt alſo take away the Covenant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and if there be a Covenant commanded, there muſt of neceſſity be a condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider that expreſſion uſed in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37. <hi>I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant</hi> (ſaith the Lord;) why doth the Lord ſpeak of a bond of the Covenant? If the Lord had bound himſelfe only, and put no condition upon the Covenant for us, he could not have ſaid that he would bring us into the bond of it; But hereby he would teach us, that when he makes with us a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace and mercy, he doth not then leave us at liberty to live as we liſt; but he binds us by Covenant to him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elfe; he doth not only bind himſelfe to us, but us to himſelfe, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.11. He is ſaid to have tyed to himſelfe the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> binding them to himſelfe as with a girdle, in the bond of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; wee were ſometimes free from God, and free from righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.20. But now we are by Covenant become the Lords ſervants, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.22. being bound unto him by the bond of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider how we are ſaid ſometimes to keep Covenant, ſometimes to break Covenant with God; In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.18. Here we are ſaid to keep Covenant; but in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17. and <hi>Eſay</hi> 24.5. There is mention made of breaking Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God; and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.25. they have forſaken the Covenant of the Lord their God. This keeping of Covenant, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t: Thus the Jewes they would hold to the promiſe, that God was their God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. and yet they brake the Covenant, by failing in the condition required of them.</p>

                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:113533:131"/>5. Conſider how the name of Covenant is given not only to the promiſe which God makes unto us, but to that duty which he requires on our part, to be done by us, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. There the name of Covenant is given to Gods promiſe which he makes to us; but afterwards in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. the ſame name of Covenant is alſo given to the duty required of us, <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham) eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee,</hi> and what is that? <hi>I will be a God unto thee, &amp;c. and thou alſo ſhalt keep my Covenant,</hi> that is, there is the duty I require of thee, by which thou ſhalt teſtifie thy obſervance of the Covenant; namely, in circumciſing thy ſeed. This uſe of the word (Covenant) being applyed to that which is required of us, ſhewes plainly that there is a ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or condition in the Covenant required on our part.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We reade expreſſe mention made of the condition, upon which the promiſe of life and ſalvation is made; as in <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.9. <hi>If thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Gods dealing with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when he made his Covenant with them at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> ſhewes plainly that there is a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.3. to 9. when the Lord was about to make up his Covenant betwixt him and them, you ſee how <hi>Moſes</hi> rehearſeth before them the words of the Covenant, that they might know what it was which the Lord required of them; and to the end it might be done more ſeriouſly, he repeats the termes of the Covenant to be obſerved by them, twice over, and they doe twice promiſe to obſerve the words of the Covenant, before the bloud of the Covenant, by which it was confirmed, was ſprinkled upon them, ſhewing unto us thereby, that we muſt for our part aſſent unto the Covenant, not only accepting the promiſe of it, but alſo ſubmit to the duty required in it; or elſe there is no Covenant eſtabliſhed betwixt God and us; we muſt as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the condition as of the promiſe, if we will be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the Covenant is otherwiſe called a Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This terme or name of Teſtament, is given to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; not to exclude the condition but to ſhew the firmneſſe, and inviolable and unchangeable nature of it, being confirmed by
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:113533:132"/> the death of Chriſt the Teſtator, and therefore never to bee altered nor changed: Whiles men live, they may alter their Wills or Teſtaments, as oft as they pleaſe; but when they are dead it is unalterable, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. Chriſt hath dyed to confirm his Teſtament, its therefore now unchangeable, being ratified by his death, as a Teſtament is by the death of the Teſtator. And that this is the true reaſon why the Apoſtle calls it a Teſtament, is evident by <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 17. <hi>Where a Teſtament is</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>there muſt be the death of the Teſtator;</hi> and he gives the reaſon, even now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, becauſe the Teſtament is confirmed when men are dead, and not before; And that the Apoſtle had no intent (in ſo calling it) to exclude the condition, is evident by verſe 15. where he ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt is made the Mediator of a better Teſtament, that through his death thoſe which were called might receive the promiſe of eternall inheritance;</hi> Theſe words (thoſe which were called) doe plainely and fully imply the condition required in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of life, our calling being finiſhed in the working of faith, which is the condition of the Covenant; no man is effectually called ſo as to have part in that eternall inheritance, untill he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſo that the Legacies of the Teſtament being to thoſe that are called, that is, to thoſe that do believe; it is moſt manifeſt that the intent of the Apoſtle in calling the Covenant by the name of a Teſtament, was not to exclude the condition, but only (as was ſaid) to ſhew the ſtability and immutability of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; It being now like a Teſtament, confirmed by the death of him that made it: The forme of the former Covenant which God made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, was changed in reſpect of the manner of Adminiſtration of it, becauſe it was not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the death of the Teſtator; but this is confirmed by death, and therefore herein neither matter nor forme can be changed any more; in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. We have Chriſt there making his laſt Will and Teſtament, to be executed by his Father; and what his Will is, we have it expreſſed in his own words, <hi>Father I will thoſe whom thou haſt given me may be where I am, &amp;c.</hi> And who thoſe be that hee meaneth by them that are given him, is plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, verſe 20. <hi>Even thoſe that believe in his name;</hi> Chriſt doth not bequeath the Legacy of his Teſtament unto all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, but to ſuch as doe believe; as for the reſt he bequeathes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But there be ſame abſolute promiſes of the Covenant, which are without any condition at all on our part, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the firſt grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We muſt conſider the Covenant not only as conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and made up with our ſelves in our own perſons, but as it was begun, and firſt made with us and for us in Chriſt, in which regard it is ſaid to bee made with us before the world began, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. a promiſe of grace being made to Chriſt for us, and to us in him: Now if we thus conſider the Covenant, as made with us in Chriſt, ſo the firſt grace it ſelfe is conditionall, as well as the laſt; Chriſt receives the promiſes of grace for us, but he receives not the leaſt of them but upon condition that he muſt lay down his life for them, that he may performe them unto us as we ſee in <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.5. Where God the Father makes a promiſe to Chriſt, that he ſhall call a Nation or People to the knowledge of himſelfe; which is a promiſe of the firſt grace given us in our firſt converſion and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: but in reſpect of Chriſt, this is not abſolute, but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as appeares in verſe 4. for he muſt be a witneſſe unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to teſtifie unto them the will of the Father, which he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his Propheticall and Prieſtly Office; yea, he muſt make his ſoule an offering for ſinne, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.10. and upon this condition he muſt have power to call a Nation, to bring them home by effectuall calling unto God; and thus in reſpect of Chriſt the very firſt Grace is conditionall, though without condition on our part.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the Covenant in reſpect of the end of it, which it leads unto, which is life and ſalvation, in which reſpect it is called a Covenant of life and peace, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:113533:133"/>3. The giving of the firſt Grace in our calling, goes before our peſonall Covenant betwixt God and us, by which we bind our ſelves unto him to take him for our God, to depend upon him, and to ſubmit our ſelves unto his will; firſt the Lord doth diſpoſe us and fit us to a walking in Covenant with him, by putting into us his own ſpirit, as it is in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. and then he requires an actuall performance of Covenant on our part, to walk according to the Grace received; Look how it was in that Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo it is in this Covenant of Grace, in reſpect of the point in hand, though otherwiſe there be wide differences betwixt them, as we have ſeen before; firſt God indues <hi>Adam</hi> with an habituall righteouſneſſe, thereby enabling him for that obedience which he was to walk in, and then having thus qualified him, the Lord enters into a Covenant with him, requiring of him to walk according to all that Law which was ſet before him, and in that way of working righteouſneſſe, to look for the life which was promiſed him; ſo it is here in the Covenant of Grace; firſt, the Lord comes and takes away from us the heart of ſtone, that evill heart of unbeliefe, and gives us a ſpirit of faith, and renewing Grace, and then draweth the ſoule into a Covenant with him, to walk with him in a way of faith, depending upon him by faith, and obeying him by faith: ſo looking for the promiſe of eternall life; Thus it was with <hi>Abraham;</hi> firſt God gives unto <hi>Abraham</hi> a believing heart, then he comes to him and tells him, <hi>Abraham, I am come to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Covenant with thee:</hi> and withall tells him what are the articles and conditions of the Covenant both on Gods part, and on <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams;</hi> on Gods part, <hi>That he will be to</hi> Abraham <hi>and to his ſeed a God to bleſſe him, and to be an alſufficient good unto him;</hi> and on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part, Requiring, <hi>That he walk before him and be upright, and keep his Covenant which was commanded him;</hi> and ſo it is with all the Adult Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> firſt, God gives us a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, beginning to renew us, then propounds to us the great things of his Covenant which he will beſtow upon us, and commands us to depend by faith upon him for the performance of them; and if we thus conſider of the giving of the firſt Grace, this doth no whit croſſe the condition of the Covenant, but makes way for it, enabling us to walk in Covenant with God; that ſo
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:113533:133"/> he may bring upon us the good which he hath promiſed us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But this putting of a condition to the Covenant of grace may ſeeme to confound it and to make it the ſame with the Covenant of works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not the having of a condition, but the identity or ſameneſſe of the condition which makes them the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; all Covenants have a condition, but all Covenants are not therefore one and the ſame, but do differ according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the conditions which are made; there being then one condition in the Covenant of works, and another in the Covenant of grace, they are therefore diſtinct Covenants, though there be a condition in both.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſee there is a condition of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>But (to come to the ſecond point before propounded) why (may ſome ſay) doth the Lord require any condition of us, and not bring us to life and glory without requiring any thing at our hand?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is meet we ſhould glorifie God and his grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, before he exalt us and bring us unto glory; in this way it was that Chriſt himſelfe went into glory, according to that Prayer of his in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee here on earth, now therefore glorifie me with thy ſelfe, with that glory which I had with thee,</hi> &amp;c. ſo muſt we doe, we muſt walke by the ſame way, we muſt here glorifie that grace, by which we look for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour and eternall life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord would hereby juſtifie the way of his grace, and ſtop the mouthes of all ſuch as ate ready to murmure againſt him, herein ſhewing his righteouſneſſe in ſaving thoſe that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; the wicked are forward to complain againſt the Lord himſelfe; they had wont to ſay, <hi>The wayes of the Lord are not equall, Ezek.</hi> 18. and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.11. there are that murmure againſt him, as if he dealt not equally with them; they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers <hi>Iude</hi> 16. ready to challenge God righteouſneſſe, that they themſelves are not ſaved as well as others; Theſe mouthes muſt be ſtopped; and when the Lord hath carried on his people, in a way of grace, through faith, patience, ſubmiſſion and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will, others continuing ſtill in their ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Its alſo for the greater conſolation of the Saints, that wee ſeeing the condition to be wrought in us, and finding our ſelves to be guided by his Spirit, and inabled in any gracious meaſure to keep the way of his Covenant which he hath appointed for us to walke in, we might thereby have the more ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, aſſuring our ſelves of the fulfilling of his gracious promiſe towards us; that his loving kindneſſe ſhall be for ever and ever on them that fear him, <hi>and keepe his covenant thinking upon his Commandements to do them,</hi> Pſal. 103.17, 18. And thus both in reſpect of glorifying of God, the ſtopping of the mouthes of the wicked, and for the comfort of the Saints, it was meet there ſhould be a condition annexed to the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to the third point, let us make a little uſe of that already delivered.</p>
               <p>If there be a condition of the Covenant, then hence it follows, That for the tryall of our intereſt in the Salvation which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant promiſeth, there can be no more direct, evident, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way taken, then by examining our ſelves concerning the condition of the Covenant, expreſſed in the conditionall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The promiſe of life is made onely to beleevers, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by other graces accompanying their faith, and therefore ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſometimes ſuch as love God, ſometimes merciful, poor in heart upright, and ſuch other, all theſe flowing from faith, faith ſhewing it ſelfe by them. Now then, faith being the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, (as we ſhall ſhew afterwards) and being known by theſe other graces accompanying it, here is the way for us to try our ſelves before God, whether the promiſe of ſalvation doe belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us even by looking to the condition of Faith, and ſuch other graces, as doe accompany it in them that doe beleive: This is ſo ſure away of tryall, that the Apoſtle himſelf directs us thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Prove your ſelves whether yee be in the faith or no:</hi> If we would know our ſelves to be ſuch as are not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be diſallowed or rejected, there is no better way to know it then by our faith. And <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us that in this way <hi>we ſhall aſſure our hearts,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14, 18, 19. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:113533:134"/> doth propound the doubt of a weak beleever, inquiring how he may know that he ſhall be ſaved; and the Apoſtle himſelf an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers his doubt, telling him that it is not by aſcending or deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hither or thither, but by looking to his faith, <hi>For if thou beleeveſt with thine heart in the Lord Ieſus, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> v. 9. This way of tryal ſheweth the true uſe of thoſe promiſes which we call conditional; we do not make the graces expreſſed in them as the matter of our righteouſneſſe, and yet neither do we caſt them aſide as if they were Legall promiſes, and not Evangelicall; but the uſe of them is thereby to try our ſelves by the graces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in them; and this is the chiefeſt way of tryall which the Word doth direct us unto; Yea I doubt not to affirme that if we will in ordinary courſe, have any tryall of our eſtates by the Word, we muſt have it in this way, by the conditionall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; The abſolute promiſes do not deſcribe the perſons to whom the bleſſings of the Covenant doe belong; onely the conditionall promiſes do point out the perſons to be ſaved, as the abſolute do ſhew the cauſe of our ſalvation; if therefore we will try, and in a way of tryall have any knowledge of our perſonall intereſt in the ſalvation promiſed, we muſt either come to know it by the conditionall promiſes, or not have it from the word at all, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yet neither would I make rhe abſolute promiſes uſeleſſe, as ſome have gone about to do with thoſe that are conditionall; I acknowledge they are of ſingular uſe; Firſt, in that they ſhew unto us the onely cauſe of our ſalvation, even free grace, and no other; Secondly, they are a foundation for the faith of adherence or dependence to ſtay upon; they yeeld a ſingular incouragement to a poor dejected ſoul that finds nothing in it ſelf but ſin and miſery, with hope to caſt it ſelfe upon the free grace of God, ſeeing he looks at nothing in us for which he ſhould ſave us, but onely to glorifie his own grace in us. But ſtill though in theſe regards there be great uſe of theſe abſolute promiſes, yet the tryall of our eſtates is not by them, becauſe they doe not note out the perſons to whom the ſalvation is promiſed, but this is done (as was ſaid) by the conditionall.</p>
               <p>There be two acts of faith, one of adherence or dependance, another of aſſurance; There be alſo two kinds of promiſes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and conditionall; marke now how theſe doe fit and anſwer
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:113533:135"/> one to the other, the abſolute promiſes to the faith of adherence, the conditionall to the faith of aſſurance; For example, God comes and ſayes; <hi>For mine owne ſake will I doe thus and thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you in an abſolute promiſe;</hi> here is a ground for the faith of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to cleave unto; though I be moſt unworthy, yet I will hang upon this promiſe becauſe it is for his owne ſake that the Lord will perform this mercy, that he may be glorified. There be alſo conditionall promiſes, <hi>(He that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved)</hi> by meanes of which (we having the experience and feeling of ſuch grace in our ſelves) we grow to an aſſurance that we are of thoſe that he will ſhew that free grace upon. And thus the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſes are laid before us as the foundation of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is wrought in the adhering to the promiſe) and the conditionall as the foundation of our aſſurance.</p>
               <p>But may not (will ſome ſay) and doth not the Lord ſometimes give comfort to his ſervants by an abſolute promiſe? and if ſo, then what need we looke to thoſe that are conditionall?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I doubt not but the Lord doth give refreſhings to the ſouls of his beloved by ſuch abſolute promiſes; for there being a ſum of grace contained in every promiſe, whether abſolute or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, the Lord may let the ſoule raſte of the comfort of that grace by what promiſe he will when the ſoule is taken up with ſome deep and ſerious meditation of that abundant grace and free goodnes of God towards us, and the minde is faſtned upon ſome expreſſion of ſuch a promiſe ſetting forth that grace unto us, the Spirit ſends down that ſweetneſſe of grace into our hearts, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us taſte and feel the comfort of it. This none will deny. But 1. the queſtion is not, whether we may taſte of comfort by an abſolute promiſe; but by what kinde of promiſe we are to try our ſelves; the Spirit may give refreſhing by an abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but our way of tryall is by the conditionall, examining our ſelves by the graces expreſſed in them, and thereupon making ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our ſelves of the mercy promiſed, which we cannot doe by the abſolute, there being nothing expreſſed in them to helpe us in this way, 2. Though comfort may he had by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſe, yet it is never given (if it be true and not a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) but where the condition of Faith and other graces are in being, and are firſt wrought; otherwiſe it is lying, falſe comfort,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:113533:135"/> not true and ſaving, 3. Though we may have comfort by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſe, yet when times of temptation doe return, when ſcruples and doubts doe afterwards ariſe in our heart, we muſt then turn to the conditionall promiſes, trying whether the graces expreſſed in them be wrought in us; and then finding in our ſelves that faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus, we doe thereby grow up in aſſurance that the former conſolation was no other but the conſolation of Gods own Spirit. So that upon the point, here is the uſuall and ordinary way of tryall of our eſtates, even to try our ſelves by the graces expreſſed in the conditionall promiſes. And though the comfort ſo taſted as was before expreſſed, be the more ſweet and delightfull whiles it is felt, yet the aſſurance which we have by the tryall of our graces, is the more conſtant and durable. If upon pretence of the ſeale and witneſſe of the Spirit in an abſolute promiſe, any ſhall deſpiſe this way of tryall by the graces that are in them, let them take heed, leaſt Sathan (who knows how to transforme himſelfe into an Angel of light) doe deceive them with falſe flaſhes of comfort, which in the end will cauſe them to lie down in ſorrow.</p>
               <p>It is but an unpleaſing buſineſſe to ſeparate and oppoſe the things which God hath ſo nearely joyned together, to oppoſe the abſolute promiſes againſt the conditionall, or the conditionall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the abſolute; the Lord hath made no ſuch ſeparation or oppoſition betwixt them; The abſolute and conditionall promiſes are both one in ſubſtance, though they differ in manner of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For when the Lord ſaith, <hi>he will forgive our ſins for his own ſake, Eſay</hi> 43. (which is an abſolute promiſe) this promiſe intends faith in thoſe in whom it ſhall be fulfilled; though he do forgive our ſinnes for his own ſake, yet he doth it only to ſuch as doe believe; faith therefore is implyed in that promiſe, though not expreſſed; And on the other ſide, when God promiſeth life to ſuch as doe believe (which is a conditionall promiſe) this promiſe implies the former freeneſſe of Grace, as was before expreſſed in the abſolute promiſe to doe it for his own ſake; the expreſſing of faith the condition, doth not exclude the freeneſſe of Grace, nor doth the expreſſing of freeneſſe of Grace exclude the condition; theſe two kinde of promiſes, help to explaine one another, not to contradict or overthrow the truth of either; When we heare a
<pb n="922" facs="tcp:113533:136"/> conditionall promiſe, (believe and be ſaved) if any ſhall now aske, Why will the Lord ſave ſuch as believe without works? To this the Lord anſwers in the abſolute promiſe, <hi>for mine own ſake will I doe it;</hi> On the otherſide, when hearing an abſolute promiſe, (As, <hi>for mine own ſake will I doe this:</hi>) If any ſhall here aske, To whom will the Lord performe this mercy promiſed? To this he anſwers in the conditionall promiſe, <hi>I will doe it to them which doe believe;</hi> ſo ſweetly doe theſe promiſes agree betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, helping to explaine and expound one another. Let us not then daſh them on againſt another, and betwixt themſelves they will not jarre. The Apoſtle found no diſagreement betwixt Grace and Faith, or betwixt being ſaved by Grace, and being ſaved by Faith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.8. and if Grace and Faith agree ſo well, then muſt the abſolute and conditionall promiſes agree alſo; the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Grace of God as the cauſe of our ſalvation; the other expreſſing the condition (Faith) by which it is received, and our intereſt in it diſcerned; this way of tryall by conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Let none count a legall courſe, as not agreeable to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Goſpel, This is that way of tryall which <hi>Paul</hi> (who was no legall Preacher) directed the Saints unto: So doth <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. to 11. v. Some that love to be wiſe above that which is written, and not according to ſobriety, deſpiſe this way as fit for novices, but not for ſuch as are perfect as they are: They have their aſſurance by revelation, ſeeing the very book of life unſealed and opened unto them, ſo that they may ſee and reade their own names written in it; it is too low a work for them to deſcend into themſelves, and to examine how it is with them <hi>within,</hi> whether they be in the faith or no. But if this people have any eare to heare, Let them take heed of ſpeaking evill of the way of the Lord, which is ſo clearely laid down in the Word; or if they be already hardned in their own way, and being wiſe in their own eyes, will count this way legall, and contrary to the free Grace of the Covenant, I doubt not to tell them, that an humble ſoule which is able to prove his eſtate in life by his faith, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces accompanying it, as holy mourning for ſinne (which they ſet ſo light by) love of God, and of the bretheren, care to pleaſe God, and ſuch like, ſhall finde more ſetled and ſure comfort, in the truth of theſe, then they ſhall doe in their fancyed

Seeing we have a promiſe left us of entering into his reſt, (there is the bleſſing promiſed) let us feare leaſt (through unbeliefe) any of us ſhould be deprived (there is the condition required:) The words <hi>(through unbeliefe)</hi> are not in the Text expreſſed, but they are evidently implyed, as appears both by the coherence with the third Chapter, and by that which followes, Chap. 4.2. To be deprived of ſuch a bleſſing is a heavy loſſe, ſuch as can never be recompenced, and the preventing of this loſſe, (ſo far as concernes us) is by keeping of our Covenant, which the Lord commands us to walk in. If we forſake the condition, we forſake the promiſe; and therefore it is alſo that when God took <hi>Abraham</hi> into a Covenant with him, he did not only tell <hi>Abraham</hi> what he would be unto him, a God to bleſſe him; but he brings <hi>Abraham</hi> to walk in Covenant with him; <hi>Thou alſo ſhalt keep my Covenant,</hi> (ſaith the Lord,) <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. <hi>Thou ſhalt walk before me and bee upright, Gen.</hi> 17 1. When God takes us into Covenant with him, we are ſaid to be brought into the bond of the Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. to teach us that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:113533:137"/> now we muſt look at our ſelves as tyed and bound unto God, in a Covenant never to be broken; we are not now any longer at our own liberty, to walke as we liſt, but muſt obſerve our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to walk therein; when we walk ſo, that we may truly ſay before the Lord, our heart is not turned back from thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we dealt falſely with thee in thy Covenant, as it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17, 18 this keeps the heart in a comfortable expectation of the bleſſed hope which is ſet before us, Thus <hi>Paul, I have kept the faith, I have finiſhed my courſe, and now henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8.

Theſe bonds of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are not like the fetters of a priſon; they are like the pleaſing bonds of wedlock; <hi>(vincula nuptiarum)</hi> which every one gladly enters into; Oh let us love theſe bonds; give up both our hands unto the Lord; yea, and our hearts alſo, to be bound in them for ever; theſe are ſweet bonds, they work no griefe; ſeek not therefore to break them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. nor caſt them from you; ſay not we will be our own, and walk by our will; ſuch lawleſſe and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious ſpirits as will be at liberty, they ſhall be at liberty to their wo: they ſhall have ſuch a liberty as <hi>Jeremy</hi> threatned to the rebellious Jewes, a liberty to the ſword, to the famine, and to the peſtilence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. a liberty to goe to hell to their eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; a liberty with a curſe; granted unto them in wrath, which ſhall end in chaines of everlaſting darkneſſe, and bring them into that priſon from whence there is no going out: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all ſuch as look for the bleſſing and life promiſed in the Covenant, Let them walk faithfully in the condition of it, and in this way expect the mercy which is promiſed.</p>
               <p>Thus wee have ſhewed; Firſt, That there is a condition of the Covenant; Secondly, Why the Lord hath put a condition unto it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third point follows to ſhew what the condition is, which though it hath been <hi>obiter</hi> mentioned before, yet is now to be ſpoken of more particularly.</p>
               <p>The condition then of the Covenant of Grace is faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. <hi>If thou believeſt in the Lord Jeſus, thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 18.31. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. hence in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. The
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:113533:137"/> Goſpel is called the Law of Faith, becauſe as the Law of works doth put works as the condition of that Covenant; ſo the Goſpel puts faith as the condition of the new Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why is faith made the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The bleſſing of life promiſed, is not in our ſelves, but in Chriſt; Chriſt is life, and he which hath the Sonne hath hath life, and he which hath not the Son hath not life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. We are dead, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.3. and our Works are dead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. there is no life in them, <hi>they</hi> cannot bring life unto them that doe them; nor can <hi>wee</hi> quicken our own ſoules, but Chriſt is the life of men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.4. and the way to receive Chriſt, and the life which is in him, is only by faith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. unbeliefe rejects Chriſt and puts him away; But faith as an hand puts forth it ſelfe to receive him in whom our life is: If we had life in our ſelves, and could have found it in our own works, it had then been needleſſe to appoint faith as the condition of the Covenant; but being that both we our ſelves are dead in ſinne, and our works are dead works, nothing but death to be found in either; therefore its required that wee believe in Chriſt, that we may receive life from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The condition of the law is now become impoſſible unto us, through the infirmity of our fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that the Law cannot poſſibly give life, Gal.</hi> 3.21. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord would go that way with us no more; the Lord ſaw by <hi>Adam,</hi> what would be the fruit of that condition; if we had been put upon the ſame as <hi>Adam</hi> was, we ſhould have done as he did; we ſhould have ſhewed our ſelves men, like men tranſgreſſing the Covenant, as <hi>Hoſeah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.7. This condition being above our ability to performe, the Lord hath in goodneſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed another, which is poſſible through grace to be fulfilled by us, having now received a ſpirit of faith, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.) It is now given us to believe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. this is poſſible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is by faith that it might be by grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ſtabliſhed upon the condition of faith, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be by grace that wee obtain the bleſſing: the condition muſt anſwer the nature of the Covenant; therefore being a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, the condition muſt be ſuch as may ſtand with
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:113533:138"/> grace; but if works had been the condition, this could not have ſtood with grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. Gods maine end in this Covenant, is the mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is faith, that the bleſſing might be ſure to thoſe to whom it is promiſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Adam</hi> had a promiſe of life, but being made upon condition of working, he never got the bleſſing by that Covenant; when <hi>Adam</hi> firſt entred into Covenant with God, it was uncertaine whether he ſhould live by it or no, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it was uncertaine whether he would fulfill the condition, and thereupon it was that he had one Sacrament of death, as well as another of life, to aſſure him of death in caſe he ſinned, as well as to aſſure him of life in caſe he obeyed: but now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life being made to us upon condition of faith, it is thereby made ſure to thoſe that doe believe; Chriſt is a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for them to reſt upon, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.16. the promiſe alſo is ſure and faithfull, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. and faith is as an anchor ſure and ſtedfaſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. and, Chriſt being ſo ſure a foundation, the promiſe ſure, and faith taking ſuch ſure hold upon both, theſe three together are as a three<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And hence it is that in this Covenant though we have two ſeales added unto it, as well as in the Covenant of works; yet there is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſeale of death: but they are both ſeales of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſuring us that if we believe in the name of the Lord Jeſus, we ſhall ſurely have everlaſting life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Faith is ſufficient to make us partakers of all the bleſſings of the Covenant; Look back unto all thoſe bleſſings before named, and you ſhall ſee how faith doth poſſeſſe us of them all. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to be a God unto us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. but how comes he to be our God? It is by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.29, 30. He promiſeth forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and to remember our iniquities no more, and it is faith which maketh us partakers of this bleſſing alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25.</p>
               <p>By faith wee are made partakers of the Spirit of holineſſe,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:113533:138"/> 
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. faith purifies the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. &amp; 26.18. By faith we are kept in the eſtate of grace unto ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. we ſtand by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.</p>
               <p>By faith we are made heires and owners of all the good things of this life; We are ſonnes by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. and being ſonnes we are alſo heires, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. even heires of the world, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. and if by faich we be partakers of Chriſt, then are we with him intereſted in all other things alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. yea, all things are ours, whether things preſent or things to come, all are ours, we being Chriſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Laſty, by faith we obtaine that great and laſt bleſſing of the Covenant even the bleſſing of eternall life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 36. So that faith alone makes us poſſeſſors of all the bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore there needs no other condition but faith alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But (may ſome ſay) if faith alone be the condition of the Covenant, and doe make us partakers of life, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, then what need is there of any obedience, or works of holineſſe? faith alone is ſufficient in ſtead of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was the old plea of looſe Libertines in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times; I have faith ſaith one, and though I have no works, yet my faith will ſave me; But underſtand, O thou vaine man (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> chap. 3.) that if thy faith be without works, ſuch faith is vaine, but like a dead carkaſſe without ſoule or ſpirit, it is dead in it ſelfe, and leaves the ſoule in death, wanting life in it ſelfe, and yeelding no living fruit, it cannot bring life unto the ſoule. A good tree ſaith Chriſt, is known by its fruit, and ſo a right and ſound faith. Let a man believe in truth, he cannot but love; and if he love, he cannot but ſeek to pleaſe God in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; faith is as a tree of life which abounds with good fruit; as therefore when a man deſires to have good fruit in his orchard, he doth not ſet the fruits themſelves in it, but plants the trees which uſe to beare the fruit, as knowing that if the trees be good and kindly, the trees will yeeld the fruit; ſo God delighteth to ſee the fruits of righteouſneſſe in the lives of his Saints, and for this end plants in their hearts the tree of faith, as knowing where this tree is planted, and takes root, the fruit will and cannot but follow; faith and holineſſe can no more be ſeparated, then light
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:113533:139"/> can be ſeparated from the Sunne; ſuch as ſay they have faith, and hope to partake in the bleſſing of the Covenant, and yet live looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, carnally, unconſcionably, they doe but deceive themſelves; they may be in Covenant with hell and death, but have no part of the Covenant of life and peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. But whereas in ſpeaking of faith, wee ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the habit, ſometimes of the act of it; It may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded which of theſe is the condition of the Covenant? whether is it the habit or the act of faith which is required of us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the latter, that is, the act, faith acting and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the promiſe, and from the promiſe, and cauſing us to live by faith in the promiſe, according to that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>the life which I now live, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God;</hi> the habit is freely given us, and wrought in us by the Lord himſelfe, to inable us to act by it, and to live the life of faith; and then we having received the gift, the habit, then (I ſay) the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us that we ſhould put forth acts of faith, both by waiting upon him, to receive from him all the good which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and by walking in all obedience of faith, in an humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his will; this work of faith the Apoſtle ſhews fully to have been in thoſe Saints, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. both in expecting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, with patient ſuffering under the hope of it, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubmiſſion to any Commandement of God; and theſe <hi>acts</hi> of faith are implyed in that expreſſion of <hi>walking</hi> by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and the <hi>work</hi> of faith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. and in that faith is ſaid to <hi>work</hi> by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. all tending to ſhew that it is the act and work of of faith which is required on our part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. It is the act of faith which receives the promiſe, and Chriſt in the promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. A man may have an hand and yet not have the gift which is offered him unleſſe hee put forth his hand to receive it; faith is the hand of the ſoule, and the putting of it forth is the act by which wee receive Chriſt offered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look as it was with <hi>Adam</hi> in that Covenant made with him, he had an habituall righteouſneſſe within him; but that was not the condition of the Covenant betwixt God and him, but the acting of that inward habit in acts of obedience, was the condition
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:113533:139"/> of the Covenant; ſo here in the Covenant of grace, firſt, God puts into us the habit of faith, and then requires of us act of faith; to lay hold of the promiſe, and to receive the grace which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> offered in the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not an habit of faith, but a life of faith which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the Saints that are in Covenant with God; it is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit which enables and fits us to live by faith; but the life of faith conſiſts in the acts of faith, put forth according to the ſeverall occaſions we meet withall, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There muſt needs be a difference betwixt that which God promiſeth as a part of the Covenant on his part, and that which he requires of us on our part; now the habit is that which God promiſeth to us: when he ſaith, <hi>I will give you a new heart, &amp;c.</hi> and this he worketh in us in our effectuall calling; and then the acting of that faith received, is that which is required on our part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what is that act or acts of faith, by which we perform the condition of the Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, there is an act of faith by which we doe (as it were) firſt cloſe with the Covenant revealed and offered unto us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is alſo another act of it, by which we are carried on to an anſwerable walking before God according to the Covenant made with him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the former before we give a direct anſwer, we muſt lay down theſe two grounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That in the making up of the Covenant betwixt God and us, God is firſt with us, he is the firſt mover, he begins with us, before we begin with him; we ſhould never ſeek to be in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, if he did not allure us, and draw us unto him, Thus in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37. <hi>I will bring them</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>into the bond of the Covenant;</hi> It is the Lord which brings them; they doe not firſt offer themſelves.</p>
               <p>And firſt God prepares his own way for entering into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, and then he finiſheth the work; and in this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he doth theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He breaks us off from our Covenant with Hell and Death, makes us ſenſible of our undone eſtate, makes us ſee that we
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:113533:140"/> are without God, without Chriſt, without hope, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. that we are not under mercy, that wee are not of his people, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He opens unto us his minde and will, ſhewing himſelfe willing to receive us to grace, and to enter into a new Covenant with us, yet againe to take us to be his people, and hee to be our God; he goes into the ſtreets and open places as it is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 21. and there makes publike proclamation, <hi>Ho, ho, every one that will, Come yee unto me, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, Eſay</hi> 55.3. <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.1. yea more, he comes and beſeeches us to be reconciled unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and ſpeaks to us as pittying us; <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. and lamenting over us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. thereby to perſwade us to come into a Covenant with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the hearing of theſe promiſes and offers of grace, the Lord uſually ſcattereth ſome little ſeeds of faith in the hearts of thoſe that he will bring unto himſelfe; which ſeed being ſown, doth ſometimes quickly put forth, and acts towards the Covenant propounded, and layes hold of it, as we ſee in <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Jaylor, <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and ſuch others; but ſometimes (and that moſt uſually) before that faith hath done any great thing in ſeeking after God, to make a Covenant with him, the Lord doth againe withdraw himſelfe, and goes away as, <hi>Hoſeah</hi> 5. end: hiding himſelfe, as if he would regard us and look after us no more; ſo that now if we will get into Covenant with him, we muſt ſeek after him, as he before ſought after us, and muſt ſue unto him for grace, to take us into Covenant with himſelfe; and herein faith begins to ſhew it ſelfe, beginning to work and move towards the Covenant which the Lord offereth to make with us.</p>
               <p>For though the Lord hath withdrawn himſelfe, yet he hath left ſuch a touch of his Spirit upon the heart as makes the ſoule affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate towards him, ſo as now it cannot reſt, but feeling its own wo, being without God, and without Covenant, and having heard of the Lords willingneſſe to enter into a Covenant with us, it now begins to ſeek after the Lord, to be in Covenant wirh him; This is the firſt ground, that God is firſt, he begins with us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond is, that whatſoever faith doth in ſeeking to enter into Covenant with God, it doth it alwayes in that way, and according to that order in which the Lord hath gone before us,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:113533:140"/> in the offer of his Covenant unto us; faith doth alwaies follow the Word, and doth nothing but as it hath a word of Faith to guide its way, it goes ſtep by ſtep as it hath the light of the word directing and going before; faith doth not preſcribe unto God, it will not preſume to appoint the conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, onely it anſwers and applyes it ſelfe to Gods offer, taking conditions of peace, but giving none. It doth not ſeek to wind about the promiſe of grace to our own minde and will. It doth not ſay I will have it thus, thus it ſhall be, or elſe I will admit of no conditions of peace; but the ſoul now finding that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting eſtate of it for weal or woe, life or death, ſtands at the meer good pleaſure and mercy of God; and knowing that either it muſt ſubmit to that way of the Covenant, and to thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which the Lord is pleaſed to ſet down, or it muſt periſh for ever; it gladly comes in humbly accepting the offer of grace, in the ſame way as it is tendred and offered unto us of God.</p>
               <p>Here then (that we may ſee how faith cloſeth with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant propounded) we muſt ſee firſt how God offers himſelfe in his Covenant unto us. Now in that main promiſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (which is indeed the ſum of all) <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> God offers himſelf unto us two wayes, (as hath been before ſhewed in the opening of that promiſe,) Firſt, he offers himſelfe unto us as a God of mercy to pardon us; as a God of bleſſing to bleſſe us with all ſufficient bleſſings. 2. As a God over us, and above us, to order us and to rule us in all our wayes, to governe us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne will that he may be glorified in us; Thus God offers himſelfe unto us in his Covenant, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now the anſwer is ready to the queſtion propounded, how faith doth act in cloſing with the Covenant; the work of faith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is to carry the ſoule towards the Covenant in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and way as it is propounded; Firſt accepting the grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, reſting upon God for all the mercy which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 2. Taking God to bee a God over us ſubmitting to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and authority, to command us and to rule us in all things according to his own will; theſe two things faith doth, and ſo takes hold of the Covenant in the ſame way and order as God offers it. 1. God makes himſelf known to us as a God of mercy, gracious, long-ſuffering, pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſſion,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:113533:141"/> and ſin, he offers himſelfe to be reconciled unto us, though we have rebelled againſt him, promiſing to be a Father unto us, and to accept of us as his ſons and daughters in his beloved.</p>
               <p>Now the worke of Faith in reſpect of this offer of grace is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accept the grace offered, to lay hold on it and take it unto our ſelves being ſo freely offered; Faith brings nothing to God of our owne, it offers nothing to ſtand in exchange for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered; it receives a gift, but giveth no price. The Lord holds out and offers the free grace of the Covenant; faith receives it, and makes it our owne. Hence is that expreſſion uſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in <hi>Eſay</hi> 56. where we are ſaid to lay hold of the Covenant; God holds it forth, and we take hold of it, the hand of grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it, and the hand of faith receives it and makes it our owne, and this it doth by ſuch ſteps and degrees as theſe that follow, wherein though I ſhould not limit the Lords dealing with all his, yet I will ſhew what I conceive is the moſt uſuall and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Gods diſpenſation towards thoſe whom he brings into Covenant with himſelfe: Here then faith cloſeth with the Covenant in this manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By hearing the great things propoſed in the Covenant, it ſtirs up in the heart a deep and ſerious conſideration of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed condition of thoſe people that are in Covenant with God; Oh what a bleſſed eſtate is it (thinkes ſuch a one,) to be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, to be one of his covenanted people? It makes him ſay with <hi>Moſes, Bleſſed art thou O Iſrael, a people ſaved by the Lord, Deut.</hi> 33. It ſaith with <hi>David, No people O Lord, is like thy people Iſrael, whom thou haſt redeemed unto thy ſelfe,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.23. Time was when we counted the proud bleſſed, and placed our felicity in other things, as in riches, preferments, favour, and credit with men, &amp;c. but now theſe are become vile and things of no value; faith makes us change our voice, and to ſpeake with a new tongue, and to ſay, not, Bleſſed are the people that be ſo, but, <hi>Bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 144. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This high eſteeme of grace being accompanied with a ſence of the want of it, wee ſeem unto our ſelves as undone men, loſt, wretched, miſerable. The poor ſoul thinkes with it ſelfe, no ſin like my ſin, no miſery like my miſery: I am ſeparated from
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:113533:141"/> the Lord, an alien from his people; Oh bleſſed are they that are are at peace, and in covenant with him! this is now the onely pearle of price; the rich treaſure in the field, for which ſuch a one is content to give all the ſubſtance of his houſe. In the prodigall when he began to thinke of returning to his father, theſe two things were found in him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a deep ſence of his owne miſery, <hi>(I die for hunger.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a conſideration of the wellfare of thoſe that were in his Fathers houſe <hi>(they have bread enough.)</hi> So it is with thoſe poor ſoules in which faith begins to work, to draw them back into Covenant with God; ſenſible are they of their own woe, highly alſo doe they prize the excellency of grace, if by any means they might attain to have a part in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This high eſteem of grace, and being in Covenant with God, begets a longing deſire of it; good being beleived, cannot but be deſired, and longed for, and therefore faith now belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the benefit of being in favour and Covenant with God, it cannot but work deſires after it; deſire naturally ſpringeth from the apprehenſion of any good made knowne. Faith is both in the underſtanding and in the will; as it is in the underſtanding, it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the eye to ſee, and clearly to diſcerne the bleſſing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and then ſtirs up the will to purſue and deſire the attaining of the grace revealed: Never did <hi>David</hi> more long for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> then ſuch a ſoul touched with the ſence of ſin, doth deſire to be at peace with God and in covenant with him, and therefore it is that they are ſaid to <hi>thirſt after the the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 42.2. <hi>to pant after him,</hi> Pſal. 42.1. to gaſpe after him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. longing for communion and peace with him. Thus in <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.9. <hi>with their ſoules they deſire him in the night, and with their ſpirit in the morning;</hi> the deſire of their ſoul is ſet upon him, and cannot be ſatisfied by any thing without him; peace with him is their life; and to be ſeparated from him, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as the ſhadow of death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith being yet weak, and but as in the bud, or in the ſeed, and being yet unacquainted with the Lords dealing with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not knowing how he uſeth by terrors of death to bring them to life and peace; hence it comes to paſſe that the ſoule being preſſed with ſence of ſin, therefore though its deſires be ſtrong,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:113533:142"/> yet hope of obtaining is but feeble and vveak, vve ſeeming to our ſelves utterly unworthy (as indeed we are) and uncapable (which we are not) of ſo high a priviledge as this is, to be in favour and Covenant with the moſt high God. Here therefore faith is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with many thoughts, thereby to ſupport and keepe up the heart in hope, carrying the eye of the ſoul towards God, though as beholding him afarre off; faine would the poor ſoul be joyned to the Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56. but being as yet diſmayed with the ſence of ſin, he ſtands like the poor Publican afar off, as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to come neere into the preſence of the holy God; as yet faith can ſcarce ſpeak a word to God, it cannot come neer to call upon him, only it can with <hi>Ionah</hi> look towards his holy Temple, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the poor weak babe which lies in the cradle, being both ſick, and weak and ſpeechleſſe, and can onely look towards the mother for helpe, the caſt of the eye (after a ſort) expreſſing and ſignifying what it would ſay: Thus doth faith being yet weak, it would ſpeak unto God but cannot, onely it hath its eye towards heaven, looking for grace and mercy according to <hi>Iehoſhaphats</hi> ſpeech, <hi>Our eyes are towards thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. It hungers and thirſts after grace, but feares it ſhall never be ſatisfied; it feeles a need and faine would have; but ſence of unworthineſſe, conſciouſneſſe of manifold ſinnes, the ſentence of the Law like the thundering and lightning at Mount Sinai, all of them being ſharpned by Satans working in them and with them, doe ſtrike ſuch a fear into the heart, (as was in <hi>Iſrael</hi> then,) that though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires be ſtirring and working, yet hope is very feeble, cauſing us to doe as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did there, who though they heard the Lord ſay, I am the Lord your God, yet the terror of the thunder made them to ſtand afar off; and ſo we, we hear the Lord offering to be our God in covenant with us, but ſuch are the diſcouragements that we dare not come near to ſeek after the grace which is revealed; Hitherto therefore the mind of the poor ſinner deſiring to bee in Covenant with God, is unquiet within it ſelfe, hurried too and fro finding no reſt; it heares of peace with God, but feels it not; but in ſtead of peace, finds trouble, feare, doubtings, diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to keep it off from the way of peace; faith being yet yong and faint, hath much adoe to ſuſtain the heart in any hope that it ſink not down in diſcouragement. But yet though it bee
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:113533:142"/> weak, it will be doing what it is able; ſetting the minde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the promiſes, and encouragements which God hath given us in his word; how hee invites all to come unto him, even every one that thirſts, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. telling us, That <hi>whoſoever comes unto him, he will not caſt away, Joh.</hi> 6.37.</p>
               <p>And hence, while the minde is poſſeſſed with theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo great a buſineſſe as making a Covenant of peace with the high God, and about ſo great an affaire as the life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſoule, cannot be tranſacted in a tumult, Therefore</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the fourth place, faith takes the ſoule aſide, and carries it into ſome ſolitary place; that there it may be alone with it ſelfe, and with God, with whom it hath to doe. This buſineſſe, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other occaſions, cannot be done together, and therefore the ſoule muſt be alone, that it may the more fully commune with it ſelfe, and utter it ſelfe fully before the Lord; Thus the poore Church in the time of her affliction, when the Lord ſeemed to hide himſelfe from her, ſhee ſate alone, as ſhe ſpeaks, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.28, 29. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.17. <hi>I ſate alone, becauſe of thy plague: The way of the Lord is prepared in the Deſert, Eſay</hi> 40.3. when the Lord will come to the ſoule, and draw it into communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; he will have his way hereto prepared in the Deſert; not in the throng of a City, but in a ſolitary Deſert place, he will allure us, and draw us into the Wilderneſſe, from the company of men, when he will ſpeak to our heart, and when he prepares our heart to ſpeak unto him, <hi>Hoſeah</hi> 2. Not that ſuch a one doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe or neglect the fellowſhip of Gods people, but he now ſees and knows full well, that his help is not in man, and therefore waits not upon the ſonnes of <hi>Adam, Mich.</hi> 5.7. He is glad to hear of any hope, and how others have beene ſuccoured and pulled out of the like diſtreſſe, &amp;c. but though he hath an eare open unto theſe and the like helps, yet the ſoule cannot reſt in them, but muſt retire it ſelfe, and get alone, where it may think its full, and ſatisfie it ſelf;e in thoughts of its own eſtate, and of the offers and promiſes of Grace, which God hath made to ſuch loſt ſinners: And whiles the ſoule is thus alone, with it ſelfe and with God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thinking of its own miſery and ſinne, ſometimes of the Lords mercy now preſented in ſuch and ſuch promiſes; ſometimes calling to minde how others have found favour with God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:113533:143"/> their ſinnes, ſometimes thinking what ſhould move the Lord thus to invite us, and call us unto him, and to give us theſe deſires after him; why (thinks the ſoule) ſhould the Lord doe thus, if there were no hope that he would receive me? whiles I ſay, the ſoule being alone, is thus exerciſed in theſe thoughts, at length the fire kindles, ſo as the ſoule can now reſt no longer, but a ſpirit of faith being within, like fire in the bones, the heart hitherto having beene as a Wine-veſſell, which hath had no vent, yet now the ſpirit within, compels him to open his lips, and to utter before the Lord the meditations of his heart: And therefore</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the fifth place, the ſoule reſolves now to go to the throne of Grace, ſuing for Grace, proving whether the Lord will bee gracious and mercifull, to accept of a reconciliation; faith ſpeaks within, as they did in <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.9. <hi>who can tell whether the Lord will return &amp;c.</hi> and as <hi>Amos</hi> 5.15. <hi>It may be the Lord may yet be mercifull;</hi> ſuch an one cannot yet ſay that he will, yet knowes not but he may be gracious, and therefore doth as thoſe lepers in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.3. who knowing that they were ſure to periſh if they ſate ſtill, reſolved to try what might befall them in going into the Camp of the <hi>Aramites;</hi> and as <hi>Eſther</hi> who would try whether the King would hold out his golden Sceper towards her, yea or no; ſo the poore ſinner, knowing how it is with him, and thinking hee muſt periſh if he thus continue, and hearing alſo ſuch gracious invitations, &amp;c. thereupon reſolves to goe and ſeek the Lord beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Grace and acceptance before him. (Doth the Lord ſay, ſeek yee my face? the heart anſwers within, Lord I will ſeek thy face; Doth the Lord ſay, Come unto me? the heart anſwereth, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.22.) And now the ſoule betakes it ſelfe unto God, ſending up complaints againſt it ſelfe, with lamentations for its own ſinfull rebellions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with ſtrong cryes to heaven, with ſighes and groanes of Spirit which cannot be expreſſed; it confeſſeth with grief and bitter mourning, all former iniquities, ſmites upon the thigh with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting <hi>Epharim,</hi> lies down at Gods foot-ſtoole, putting its mouth in the duſt, acknowledging Gods righteouſneſſe if he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and caſt off for ever, and yet withall pleads for Grace, that it may be accepted as one of his; It ſayes unto God, <hi>Lord, I have
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:113533:143"/> nothing to plead why thou maiſt not condemn me; but if thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, thy mercy ſhall appeare in me, thou maiſt ſhew forth all thy goodneſſe; take away therefore all mine iniquities, and receive mee graciouſly, Hoſeah</hi> 14.3. It pleads Gods promiſe, Lord, thou haſt ſaid thou wilt be gracious; Lord make good this word to the ſoule of thy ſervant, be my God, my mercifull God, and make me thy ſervant; thus the ſoule lies at the throne of Grace and pleads for Grace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As faith is thus earneſt in ſuing to God for Grace and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, ſo it is no leſſe vigilant, and watchfull in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and taking notice what anſwer comes from the Lord, how he anſwers the deſires we have preſented before him. As the priſoner at the barre, not only cries for mercy, but marks every word which falls from the Judges mouth, if any thing may give him hope, and as <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants lay at catch with the King of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> to ſee if they could take occaſion by any thing which fell from him, to plead for the life of <hi>Benhadad;</hi> ſo doth the poore ſoule that is now pleading for life and grace, it watcheth narrowly to ſee if any thing may come from God, any intimation of favour, any word of comfort that may tend to peace; thence it is that the Saints have ſo often called upon God for anſwer of their prayers; they thought it not enough to pray, but they would ſee how the Lord anſwered them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.1, 2. Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>O let me heare joy and gladneſſe, &amp;c. David</hi> did not only pray for mercy, but deſires to heare from heaven a word ſpoken to his conſcience, by which he might know he was accepted; though <hi>David</hi> was not in the beginning of that work we now ſpeak of, yet the caſe is alike, he was now in his own ſence as if he had been to begin anew, and thus in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>I will heare what the Lord will ſay, for he will ſpeak peace unto his people, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. As faith doth thus wait for an anſwer from God, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe according as the Lord doth either anſwer or not anſwer, ſo doth faith demeane it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sometimes he anſwers not, to our ſence (I mean) and diſcerning, as we ſee in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe; he felt himſelfe as one forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and prayed unto God, but found no audience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. What doth faith in this caſe? it followes God ſtill, and cryes after him with more ſtrength and earneſtneſs, as reſolving never to give over,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:113533:144"/> till the Lord either ſave or deſtroy; if the Lord will deſtroy, yet the ſoule chuſeth to die at Gods foot, as <hi>Joab</hi> did at the hornes of the Altar, when he was bidden to come forth from thence, to take his death in another place; Nay (ſaith <hi>Ioab) but I will die here;</hi> Here the humbled ſoule doth as that woman did in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. ſhee ſues to Chriſt, but Chriſt ſeemes to have no regard of her, gives her not one word, but ſhee ſeeks ſtill; ſtill ſhe cryes after him, and though ſtill repulſed, yet ſhee comes a third time, and cryes, <hi>Lord help me;</hi> and though ſtill the Lord gives her another repulſe, yet ſtill ſhe hangs upon him, and follows him for mercy, and would never give over till ſhe he had gotten even what ſhee deſired. Even as Chriſt in his agony, when he ſaw deliverance came not, he prayed more earneſtly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44. ſo doth the poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the time of his agony, when he is ſtriving, as for life, and death; if help come not at firſt call, he prays againe, and that more earneſtly; faith will be urgent with God, with an humble impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and the more ſlack the Lord ſeemes to be in anſwering, the more inſtant is faith in plying God with prayers. It will be wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did with the Angel; it will not reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bleſſing, it will take no denyall, but will crave ſtill, as hee did, <hi>bleſſe me, even me alſo, ſend me not away without a bleſſing;</hi> it reſolves to wait, and look up, <hi>untill the Lord ſhew mercy, Pſal.</hi> 123.2. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.49, 50.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sometimes againe the Lord doth anſwer, but yet he ſpeaks but as out of the dark cloud giving ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> little eaſe, but not ſpeaking full peace; much like as he ſpake to the woman, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Goe thy way and ſinne no more,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; he doth not ſay, goe in peace, thy ſinne is forgiven thee (that had been a word of full comfort) but <hi>goe thy way and ſinne no more;</hi> a middle kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, neither aſſuring her that her ſinne was pardoned, nor yet putting her out of hope, but it might be forgiven. And hereby faith gets a little ſtrength, and looks after the Lord with more hope, and begins to plead with God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, Lord thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to ſhew grace unto thy ſervant; goe on Lord to manifeſt in me all thy goodneſſe; here faith takes a little hold on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, though with a feeble hand, as yet ſhaking and trembling for want of ſtrength, and yet now it begins to follow the Lord with more encouragement, as finding that its former ſeeking hath not been wholly in vaine.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Sometimes againe the Lord ſpeaks more fully and ſatisfactorily to the ſoules of his people; applying ſome promiſe of Grace to the conſcience by his own ſpirit, letting the ſoule feele and taſte the comfort of ſuch a promiſe, more effectually then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it could before; it hath often heard and thought on ſuch a promiſe, but could never feele any peace in it, becauſe it could never apply it to its own particular; but now being applyed by the help of the Spirit, it finds and feeles peace.</p>
               <p>Here then the Lord doth not any longer hold the ſoule in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and doubting, by propounding unto it ſuch promiſes of hope, (as I may ſo call them) It may be yee ſhall bee hid in the day of wrath, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. but he ſpeaks full peace, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 41.10. <hi>Feare not, for I am thy God; I will ſubdue your iniquities, and caſt all your ſinnes behind my back, and I will remember them againſt you no more; I have received a reconciliation,</hi> Iob 33. <hi>Goe in peace.</hi> Here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith waxeth bold, and with a glad heart entertaineth the promiſe thus brought home unto it; the Apoſtle expreſſeth this with a word very ſignificant, calling it an embracing of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. embracing implyes an affectionate receiving, with both armes opened, to ſhew an heart enlarged to thoſe that come unto us; and now the ſoule having thus embraced the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the promiſe, and having him (like <hi>Simeon</hi>) in our armes, it layes him in the boſome, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before gone forth to meet him, hee being now come, it brings him into the chamber of the heart, there to reſt, and abide for ever; now the ſoule poſſeſſeth him as her own, reſts in him, and is ſatisfied with him, layes it ſelfe down in a holy reſt, after all its former troubles, prayſing God for his mercy as <hi>Simeon</hi> did when he had Chriſt in his armes, and committing it ſelfe for ever to that mercy and goodneſſe which hath been thus revealed unto it.</p>
               <p>And thus the poor ſoul which hath been at emnity with God, comes by little and little to touch the top of the golden Scepter, and to enter into a Covenant of peace with the high God; now the hand is given to the Lord; as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpake 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. As God reacheth out to us the hand of Grace and of ſaving help; ſo doe wee give unto him the hand of faith, yeilding up our ſelves unto him, committing our ſelves unto him to bee kept by
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:113533:145"/> him unto ſalvation according to his Covenant and promiſe.</p>
               <p>And thus is this part of the Covenant made up betwixt God and us, and the ſoule now ſayes within it ſelfe, I that was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an enemy, he hath now reconciled unto himſelfe; I that was in times paſt without God, without Chriſt, without promiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Covenant, without hope, none of Gods people, not under mercy; yet now I have God for my God, Chriſt is my peace, in him I have obtained mercy, and am now become one of Gods people; the Covenant of his peace now belongs unto me, the Lord alſo is become my ſalvation; and here the ſoule reſts, and is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, as with marrow and fatneſſe; ſaying as <hi>Jacob, The Lord hath had mercy on me; therefore I have enough, I have all that my heart hath deſired, Gen.</hi> 33.11.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how faith cloſeth with the firſt part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that God will be a God of mercy unto us, to bleſſe us with bleſſings of peace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the other part of it; wherein God offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto us to be a God over us, to rule us and govern us in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will, faith works the ſoule to a cloſing with this alſo.</p>
               <p>The converting ſinner, having taſted the fruit of his own former wayes, and finding how bitter and evill it is that he hath ſinned, doth now deſire to reſign up himſelf to the Lords government, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deny his own will, and to take up the Lords yoke, and to be ſubject thereunto; he now ſayes no more, who is Lord over me, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 12. He doth no longer look at himſelf as his own, to live to himſelf, after his own minde and will; but being weary of his own wayes, and finding it ſufficient (and too much) that he hath ſpent the time paſt in the luſts of the fleſh, now he commits himſelfe to the Lords government, taking him to be a God over him; to rule and order him in all his wayes: The Covenant which paſſeth betwixt God and us, is like that which paſſeth between a King and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the King promiſeth to rule and govern in mercy and in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; and they againe promiſe to obey in loyalty and in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; faith ſets up God upon his throne, and ſayes; Let the Lord reigne for ever and ever, reigne thou over mee, (O Lord) and lead me in the way which leads unto thee. And this doth faith work in us by theſe or the like meanes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith looks at the manner of Gods invitation and call, when
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:113533:145"/> he invites us to come and enter into Covenant with him; he doth not offer himſelfe to be a God to us to bleſſe us, without being a God over us, to order and govern us, but links theſe two both together; If we will have his bleſſing, his peace, we muſt bee under his Dominion: Look as in a Common-wealth or Kingdom, none hath the benefit of the Law, but thoſe that ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Law: none have the protection of authority, but thoſe that obey it; ſo here; God doth not promiſe to pardon our ſins, leaving us ſtill at our own liberty to live as we liſt, but if he doe at all make a Covenant with us, he will be a God to us, as well to rule us, as to ſave us; To ſay, live as yee will, ſinne as yee will, and yet you ſhall be ſaved, is the Devils Covenant, not Gods; and therefore it is that when the Lord calls us into a Covenant with himſelfe, he bids us come out from among the wicked, ſeparate your ſelves, and touch no uncleane thing ſaith the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. and in this way he promiſes to receive us, and to be a God unto us; How vile ſoever we have been before time, it hinders us not from entring into Covenant with God, but if we will now become his people, we muſt <hi>henceforth</hi> walke no more as we had wont to doe; we muſt <hi>henceforth</hi> be ſeparate from our uncleanneſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>Come let us reaſon together, let us make an agreement, but withall waſh you, make you clean, &amp;c.</hi> This is the Lords manner of invitation, ſo that faith ſees a neceſſity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to Gods authority, becauſe it may not take hold of one part of the Covenant without the other: If we will have God to bee our God to pardon us, and to bleſſe us, wee muſt have him a God over us to govern us after his own will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith opens the underſtanding, convincing us by arguments, how juſt, how equall and reaſonable it is, that God ſhould rule and we obey; by faith we ſee the inviſible things of God, that is, his eternall power and Godhead, which before we ſaw not; by faith we ſee him in his Excellency and Majeſty, cloathed with glory and honour, riding upon the Heavens, attended upon with thouſand thouſands of Angels miniſtring unto him: By faith we ſee him moderating the whole world by his wiſdome and power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. We look at him as King of Kings, as Prince of all the Rulers of the earth; Neither doe we by faith thus ſee God, as he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but as he is to us, as having power in his hand either to ſave
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:113533:146"/> or deſtroy; ſo that there is no reſiſting; we know now that if we fall upon that ſtone, by our rebellion, it will grinde us to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; now there is no more queſtion made, who ſhall have the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, though in times paſt we had ſaid, this man ſhall not reign over us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. yet now it is our chiefe deſire, that his Kindome may come into us and beare ſway in us; Faith ſets before us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the benefits and kindneſſe of God towards us, and ſo perſwades us by thoſe mercies of God to give up our ſelves as a ſacrifice in humble obedience unto his will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. Faith reaſoneth in the heart as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I will prayſe thee O Lord with my whole heart; yea, I will glorifie thy name for ever, for great is thy mercy towards me, thou haſt delivered my ſoule from the loweſt grave, Pſal.</hi> 86.12, 13. Faith makes us ſpeak to God as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did to <hi>Gideon,</hi> when he had delivered them out of the hand of the <hi>Midianites, Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>unto him, and reign over us, both thou and thy ſon, for thou haſt delivered us out of the hand of</hi> Midian, Iudg. 8.22. <hi>Now God is counted worthy of all honour and ſervice,</hi> Apoc. 4.7. &amp; 5.12.13. Worthy to be exalted and glorified; thus faith urgeth it as a thing moſt reaſonable, that God ſo glorious in himſelfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power over us, to ſave or deſtroy, and when he might have deſtroyed us, yet hath ſaved us from ſo great a death, and prepared for us ſo great ſalvation, ſhould be glorified by us, wee ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves unto the obedience of his will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith makes us look at the Lords government as a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full goverment, bringing peace and bleſſing unto thoſe that are under it; it looks at this King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as a mercifull King, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. It counts thoſe ſubjects happy that are free of this Kingdome, and thoſe ſervants happy that ſtand before this King, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. It makes the ſoule lament its bondage under other Lords; as in <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.13. Lord (ſaith the Church there) other Lords beſides thee, have ruled over us, but in thee is our onely hope; having felt the miſery of thoſe former ſlaveries in which it hath been holden, having been in the Iron Furnace of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſate by the waters of <hi>Babel,</hi> and wept there, having been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch cruell Lords, now they are weary of the yoke of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor; and now the bleſſing of the Lords government, the Laws of God which were before counted as cords and bands, fitter for bondſlaves then for free-men, are now eſteemed holy, and juſt,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:113533:146"/> and good <hi>Rom</hi> 7. Faith believes that which the Lord hath ſaid, that he hath given us his Commandements <hi>for our good,</hi> that it may goe well with us for ever, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith reconciles the heart unto God, it doth not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is reconciled unto us, but alſo reconciles us unto God, whereas before we hated him, and would none of him, and thruſt him away from us, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> 7.27. Yet now the ſoule having by faith believed his goodneſſe towards us, is thereby reconciled unto him, it layes down all weapons of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſubmits in love. Like as a Traytor having found the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favour of his Prince, in pardoning his treacherous practiſes, his naughty heart which was before ſo full of treachery, is now overcome with this undeſerved favour; ſo we alſo, having been in times paſt rebels againſt God, haters of him, enemies unto him, having had our mindes ſet upon evill things, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. are now over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his goodneſſe towards us, our heart is turned to him, our hatred is turned into love, faith working love cauſing us to love him, for that great love wherewith hee hath loved us in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. So that now we come to God, as they did to <hi>David,</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.18. Thine are we, we are wholly thine: And thus faith ſlayes the hatred, and puls down the partition wall which was betwixt God us, reconciles the enmity, and makes of two one, working peace and love; ſo that now the believing ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing more then to bee ſubject to his government; and grieves when it is hindred, that it cannot doe that which he hath commanded: And thus the Covenant is made up in both parts of it, offered unto us by God, and received of us by faith, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.34.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As faith cloſeth with the Covenant, and brings us into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; ſo it doth alſo act and work in us, to enable us to walk with God according to the Covenant which we have made with him; there is a keeping of Covenant required of us, as well as a making of Covenant with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 7, 9. in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. the Saints are ſaid to <hi>make</hi> a Covenant with God; but in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.18. they are ſaid to <hi>keep</hi> his Covenant; ſo there is both a making, and a keeping of Covenant; and both theſe are done by faith; faith doth firſt enter us into Covenant with God (as we have ſeen above) and then by the ſame faith we are carried on to a keeping of the Covenant made; and that according to both parts of the Covenant, before laid down.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:113533:147"/>1. Whereas God enters into Covenant with us, to heale our back-ſlidings, to bleſſe us with all kinds of bleſſings convenient for us; Now the work of faith is to carry on the ſoule in a continuall dependence upon God for all the good which he hath promiſed; If we be in danger, faith looks unto God for ſafety and deliverance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.25. It believes the promiſes of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and depends upon them; If we have ſinned, and done the things wee ſhould not, faith brings the ſoule back unto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in a way of repentance; and looks to the faithfulneſſe and ſtability of his Covenant; hoping ſtill to finde mercy, and forgiveneſſe with him, albeit we have ſinned againſt him; and ſo in all other occaſions which befall us in this life, according as any evill preſſeth upon us, or any bleſſing is wanting unto us, faith hath recourſe to the promiſe and Covenant of God; waiting upon him for all that mercy which we ſtand in need of in every kind: And when we doe thus put forth our faith in the exerciſe and acts of it, depending by it upon God in all our occaſions, this is the life of faith, which the Scripture ſpeaks of, this is to live by faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. and to walk by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>And this life of faith is then eſpecially ſeen, when the courſe of Gods providence and dealing with us ſeemes to make againſt his promiſe; herein the life of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was ſeen; that though his body grew more impotent, and dead every yeare, yet God having promiſed him a Son, <hi>Abraham</hi> believes even above hope; notwithſtanding the deadneſſe of his body, and of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb. And ſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> God having promiſed good to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though for the preſent he ſaw nothing but wants and neceſſities and mortality among the people, ſo many thouſands dying in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe; yet was he ſo confident of Gods goodneſſe towards that people, that he was bold to promiſe good to <hi>Jethro</hi> his Father-in-Law, in caſe he would joyn himſelfe unto them, and be one of them, <hi>Come with us</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> unto him) <hi>and we will doe thee good, for God hath promiſed good unto Iſrael, Num.</hi> 10.29. When <hi>Moſes</hi> promiſed to doe him good, hee might have ſaid, You may bring me to ſorrow, and miſery enough, here you are in a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wilderneſſe where you ſometimes want water and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat; and here you die, and your carkaſes fall in the Wilderneſſe; what good can I expect that you can doe for mee?
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:113533:147"/> and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> by the power of faith, is confident to promiſe him good. God (ſaith he) hath promiſed good unto <hi>Iſrael. Moſes</hi> looks beyond the preſent workes of Gods providence, and conſiders the ſtability of Gods promiſe, and that doth he reſt upon; God not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as man that he ſhould lye or repent, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. therefore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> concludes. Let the Lord for the preſent doe as he will; let all things ſeem to croſſe his promiſe never ſo much, yet this I am ſure of, God hath promiſed good to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore good ſhall come; and thus doth faith enable the ſoule to walke in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, depending upon him for that mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which he hath promiſed. God ſaith, I will be a God unto thee to bleſſe thee, and to doe thee good; and this I require of thee, that thou truſt to me, and depend upon me for all the good thou ſtandeſt in need of; and faith doth ſo, it reſts upon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. And thus faith fulfills this part of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the other part of the Covenant, <hi>(I will be a God over thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,)</hi> to this faith aſſents alſo, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us on in an anſwerable converſation, thereby teſtifying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world, that we have ſet up the Lord to be our God, to command us, and to rule us, and that we have given up our ſelves to be his people; And here are ſundry acts of faith by which it inables us ſo to walk. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith hath alwayes an eye to the rule and command of God which he hath ſet before us to walke by, it attends conſtantly to the Tables of the Covenant; in things to be beleived it looks to the promiſe; and in things to be practiſed it looks to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. As in matters of faith it will beleeve nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a word of faith to reſt it ſelf upon; ſo in matters of fact, it will doe nothing without a word to command or warrant that which is done, becauſe without a word it cannot be done in faith, and it is no act of faith which is not done in faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. Faith will preſent no ſtrange fire before the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. It is inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive to underſtand what the will of the Lord is, as knowing that he accepts nothing but what is according to his own will and word; therefore it is that <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Teach me good judgement and knowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dge, for I have beleeved thy Commandements, Pſal.</hi> 119.66. as if he ſhould ſay, I beleve and know that what thou comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt is good, teach me to judge aright and know thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:113533:148"/> faith will be circumſpect and fearfull, till it ſee a word to direct and warrant its way; but when it ſees a plain word, then it growes bold and confident as knowing that this way is right. This then is the worke of faith, to attend to the word of faith in every thing; if we be to perform any act of worſhip unto God, it will worſhip him not after the traditions and precepts of men, but after the will of God; if we bee to perform any office of love, mercy, or juſtice towards men, it hath an eye to the word in all theſe, to doe every thing according to the pattern ſet down in the word; to walk without a word to direct us by, is the work of unbeliefe not of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Faith takes direction from the true rule, ſo it directs us to the right end, it lifts us up above our ſelves, and above our owne ends and aimes, making God our higheſt and chiefeſt end, for which we live and work, as we are of him, and live in him and by him, ſo by faith we live to him and for him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p>Reaſon tells us we muſt be for our ſelves, but faith tells us we muſt be for God; this God claimes as his right and due, and faith alſo aſſents unto; God faith, <hi>Thou ſhalt glorifie me, Pſal.</hi> 50.15. Faith ſaith, I will glorifie thee for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Faith ſhields us againſt the hindrances and temptations which we daily meet withall in our Chriſtian courſe; ſometimes we are tempted on the right hand by the baites and allurements of the world, as Chriſt was <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. All this will I give thee, ſaith the World if thou wilt be mine; but here Faith overcomes the world, (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4.) by ſetting before us better things then theſe; even a better and more enduring ſubſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. thoſe earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which ſeem ſo pleaſing to the eye of ſence, are but empty and vain ſhaddowes in the eye of faith, which looks at things afar off, at things to come, at things within the vaile, where Chriſt the fore-runner is gone before to prepare a place for us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again we are tempted on the left-hand with croſſes, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, afflictions, and ſufferings for the Name of Chriſt, by which Sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n ſeekes to turne us out of the way, and to make us falſifie our Covenant with God; but here alſo our faith helpes us to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and makes us conquerors through Chriſt that hath loved us, by ſetting before us the end of our patience and faith, telling us
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:113533:148"/> that theſe ſhort ſufferings of this preſent time, will bring unto us an eternall waight of glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. and that all the ſufferings of this preſent life are not worthy of the glory to be revealed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. and thus faith makes us to deſpiſe the ſhame and the ſorrow which we now ſuffer, <hi>looking to the joy which is ſet before us, Heb.</hi> 12.2. and thus faith is our victory by which we overcome the world, and do continue faithful and ſtedfaſt in our Covenant unto the end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith incourages us unto well doing, by perſwading us that our ſervices are accepted of God in Chriſt; and by propounding unto us the promiſes of reward.</p>
               <p>Firſt it perſwades us of acceptance that the Lord will have a gracious reſpect unto our ſervices which we preſent before him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. The Lord hath promiſed to accept our ſervices which are done in faith, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.7. and thereby faith encourageth us to every good worke: The beleever knowes all his workes as they come from him to be full of imperfection, yet conſidering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that it is Gods good and acceptable will, which he conformes himſelfe unto, and offering up his ſervice in Chriſts name, hence faith looks for acceptance according to that witneſſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35. And this is no ſmall incouragement to well doing, when we believe what we doe ſhall be accepted graciouſly. What will not a ſubject do, if he know his King will take in good part the ſervice which is tendred unto him? ſometimes they run themſelves out of all to humour them: Now faith aſſures us that there is not one prayer, one holy deſire, one good thought, or word, or good purpoſe which is thought or ſpoken or done to the glory of God, but God takes notice of it and accepts it in good part, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, faith aſſures us of a reward which ſhall be given us, faith ſees a recompence in the hand of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he will not forget our labour of love which we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto his name; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. but will one day ſay unto us, come hither, <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſervant, enter into thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Faith doth not onely encourage us unto well doing, but it doth furniſh us with ſtrength and ability by which we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fome; Faith is a ſtrengthening grace, renewing our ſtrength as the Eagles, increaſing power in our inward man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16, 17.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:113533:149"/> unbeleefe weakens the heart, and makes the hands to hang down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. and doth not onely diſcourage, but alſo diſable unto that which is good; but faith makes us full of power and ſtrength by the Spirit of the Lord, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.8. to goe through the worke which is committed unto us; ſo as if we want ſtrength, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we want faith, or at leaſt do not make uſe of our faith as we ſhould do.</p>
               <p>Now there is a twofold ſtrength and power which we get by faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a power inherent and dwelling in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a power aſſiſting and being with us.</p>
               <p>By faith we get a power of grace inherent and abiding in us, and that is in this manner, and by theſe meanes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By faith we look at Chriſt as having all fulneſſe of grace in himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. All others (Angels or Saints) have but their meaſure, ſome more, ſome leſſe, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.7. but Chriſt hath received the ſpirit not by meaſure but in the fulneſſe of it, <hi>John</hi> 3.34. Faith looks at this fulneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By faith we know that what ever fulneſſe of grace is in Chriſt, he hath received it not for himſelfe only, but for us, that he might communicate unto us, and we might receive from him; In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. it is ſaid, <hi>He received gifts for men;</hi> not for himſelf, but for men, that we might receive from him; and thence it is that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſſe we receive grace for grace;</hi> his wiſedome is to make us wiſe; his meekneſſe and patience, to make us meek and patient, and ſo in the reſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By faith we look at Chriſt as faithfull to diſtribute unto us all ſuch grace as he hath received for us; he is faithfull in all the houſe of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. faithfull in diſpenſing all the treaſure of grace committed unto him for his Churches good; he keeps no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing backe, his faithfulneſſe will not ſuffer him to keep that to himſelfe which he hath received for us; but as he hath received all for us, ſo in faithfulneſſe he will communicate the ſame unto us according to our need; and therefore it is that as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. he is ſaid to receive gifts for men, ſo in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. The Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the ſame place of the Pſalme, he changeth the word <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> into <hi>giving,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>He gave gifts unto men;</hi> as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:113533:149"/> ſo hee gives, being faithfull in all that is committed to him; and this faithfulneſſe of Chriſt, doth faith look at, that we may receive grace from him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith looks at the promiſe of Chriſt, promiſing to give us his ſpirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. upon him reſts a ſpirit of ſtrength, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11.2. and he hath promiſed, that the holy Ghoſt ſhall take of his, and ſhall give unto us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. and that the father ſhall give the holy Ghoſt unto thoſe that deſire him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. theſe promſes faith feeds upon, and ſucks life and ſpirit out of them, begging performance of them according to our need. Doe we want wiſdome, meekneſſe, patience, or any other grace? faith carries us by prayer to this fountaine, and in this way waits for, and expects to receive the grace we want; as the childe by ſucking the breaſt, draws forth milk for its own nouriſhment, and thereby grows in ſtrength, ſo doe we by the prayer of faith ſuck from the promiſe of grace, and doe thereby derive ſtrength to our inward man to enable us unto all wel-doing: And thus it is, that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. we are ſaid to receive the promiſe of the ſpirit by faith, which ſpirit being a ſpirit of power, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. and being thus received by faith, we ſee how faith enables us with all power to fulfill the Covenant which we have made with God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith gets an aſſiſting ſtrength from Chriſt; Beſides that which is inherent, dwelling within us, there is an aſſiſting power of Chriſt, by which he helps his ſervants that caſt themſelves upon his help; In thoſe great works which were done by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, it was not any indwelling power within themſelves, by which they did them, but a power of God without them, aſſiſting and working with them; and ſo it is (after a ſort) in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary duties we take in hand. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.26. In carrying the Ark God helped the Levites which were to beare it, the Lord aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted them; and this doth the Apoſtle alſo ſeeme to point unto, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. ſpeaking of his aboundant labour in the Goſpel, hee ſaith, <hi>yet it is not I, but the grace of God which is with me;</hi> he doth not ſay, which is <hi>in me,</hi> though there was ſuch grace within him alſo; but which is <hi>with me,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) as implying an aſſiſting grace, ſtrengthening him to doe above that which any thing in himſelfe could have reached unto; Compare together, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. in the one of theſe places, the Apoſtle bids <hi>us</hi> to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:113533:150"/> reſiſt Sathan by faith; but in the other place, <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that it is God which treads Sathan under our feet; both theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together imply thus much, that the faith within us, muſt bee working in reſiſtng of Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>han; but yet the power by which we overcome him, is not by the power of faith or any grace in us alone; but the aſſiſting power of God without us, is that which ſubdues Sathan to us, and treads him under our feet. This aſſiſting power the Lord hath promiſed to his people, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.9, 10. And faith reſts upon theſe promiſes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. and this makes all things poſſible to a believer, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.23. becauſe faith ſets Gods own power awork, to work that by us which of our ſelves we could never doe; he works all our works for us, while we reſt upon him for help, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.12. Thus faith furniſheth us with all ſtrength, enabling us to walk with God in a holy converſation, according to the tenour of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As faith doth thus ſtrengthen us, &amp;c. ſo if at any time wee be by occaſion over taken with any fault; faith recovers us out of our falls, and reſtores us againe to our former eſtate; the true believer though he doth not deale falſely with God in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17. yet he may and ſometimes doth walk weakly in the keeping of it, becauſe he doth not ſtirre up his faith, in which his ſtrength lyeth; though his heart is not turned back, yet his foot may ſometimes goe out of the path; many ſlips Gods own covenanted people are ſubject unto: But though they fall and fall often, yet they do not ſo fall, but they riſe againe; they turn aſide, but yet they return again into the way of the Covenant; faith brings us back to God in exerciſes of humiliation, and renewing of our repentance before him; It caſts ſhame upon our faces, that after all the grace which hath been ſhewed unto us, we ſhould ſo requite the Lord, with ſuch undutifull carriages, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>Ezrah</hi> 9.6. But yet it doth withall encourage us with hope, ſpeaking thus in the heart of a believer, yet there is hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> for all this, <hi>Ezrah</hi> 10.3. It remindes us of thoſe promiſes, <hi>Return unto mee, and I will return unto you, Zach.</hi> 1. <hi>Ye have indeed ſinned a great ſinne, ye have done all this wickedneſſe; but yet depart not from following the Lord; for the Lord will not forſake his people, whom he hath pleaſed to make his people,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20, 21, 22. By theſe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:113533:150"/> and ſuch other promiſes, faith encourageth us to return unto our God, taking words unto our ſelves and pleading the Covenant of his grace towards us, intreating him to receive us graciouſly, <hi>Hoſeah</hi> 14. This work of faith brought <hi>Peter</hi> back to Chriſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſhamefull denyall of him, it made him to lament his ſinne, and to look up unto him for grace and forgiveneſſe, whereas <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> wanting this faith, lies down in deſperate ſorrow, never able to riſe up nor recover himſelfe any more.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee how faith doth act, both in bringing us into Covenant with God, and helps us alſo to walk in Covenant with him.</p>
               <p>And thus we have ſhewed; firſt, That faith is the condition of the Covenant; ſecondly, Why faith is appointed to be the condition rather then works; thirdly, It is the act, not the habit which is the condition on our parts; fourthly, What thoſe acts of faith be, by which it brings us into Covenant, and inables us to walk in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But here a further queſtion is made by ſome, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of condition faith is; It's granted (will ſome ſay) that faith is a condition, but it is a condition only conſequent to our Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo to our being in Covenant with God; but its no antecedent condition; wee are (as they conceive) in a ſtate of Grace and ſalvation before faith and then faith comes and believes that Iuſtification and ſalvation which was before given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſome of that new light which the old age of the Church hath brought forth; which what it tends unto, I know not, unleſſe it be to this that a man ſhould not look at any habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace in himſelfe, whether ſanctification or faith, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in as much as theſe availe nothing (according to them) to a mans Iuſtification, ſeeing wee are Iuſtified before faith: They would have a man to ſee nothing in himſelfe, becauſe (as they think) the Grace which is ſeene is temporall; the Grace which is not ſeen is eternall; though a man knows that he hath faith, yet (ſay they) he is not thereby juſtified, nor brought into the eſtate of grace, but is juſtified before faith; therefore never look at this or that in your ſelves, all theſe are nothing to your Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or ſalvation: This (as I think) is the end of this opinion.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:113533:151"/>
               <p>In oppoſition whereunto, I lay down this concluſion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, That we are not actually juſtified, nor in a ſtate of grace and ſalvation, before faith, before we believe; This I hope to prove by evidence of the word; only before I come to the proof of it, to prevent miſtake, obſerve how I ſpeak of actuall Iuſtification, whereas our Iuſtification may be conſidered either, Firſt, as purpoſed and determnied in the minde and will of God; Or ſecondly, as impetrated and obtained for us by the obedience of Chriſt; Or thirdly, as actually applyed unto us, ſo as we may be truely ſaid to be actually juſt in the ſight of God; in the two former reſpects it is not denyed; God purpoſed to juſtifie us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, and therefore much more before our faith; And that atonement and obedience which Chriſt hath performed for us, is alſo before our faith, and before we were born.</p>
               <p>But the queſtion is whether this Righteouſneſſe wrought for us by Chriſt, bee actually applyed to a ſinner before hee believe; whether one, as yet not believing, bee actually acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his ſinne and accounted juſt and righteous before God.</p>
               <p>And this is that which I am now to prove, againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of the former opinion; <hi>ſc.</hi> that we are not actually juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before faith; Its not a condition only conſequent, but ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to our actuall juſtification, and being in ſtate of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. To make our juſtification goe before faith, is to place our juſtification before our vocation and calling, and ſo inverts the order obſerved by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. who placeth our calling before our juſtification, and if our calling be before our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then is our faith alſo before it; becauſe we are not called effectually (of which kinde of calling we now ſpeak, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth) untill we believe; faith therefore being comprehended in our calling, and calling being before juſtification, faith alſo of neceſſity muſt goe before our juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Conſider the words of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. where he ſaith, <hi>That the righteouſneſſe of God, is by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all and upon all that believe;</hi> In which words are three things; firſt, What is that righteouſnſſe by which we are juſtified: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not our own righteouſneſſe, but the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, here called the righteouſneſſe of God; ſecondly, The perſons upon
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:113533:151"/> whom this righteouſneſſe comes, that they may be juſtified by it, and that is, upon thoſe that doe believe; thirdly, The meanes by which it comes to be upon them, and that is by faith, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God is by faith on them that doe believe; juſtification is here limited to them that doe believe, not extended to them that believe not; and leaſt any ſhould evade by ſaying that they are called believers in regard of Gods preſcience and foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; not in reſpect of any preſent habit of faith, actually dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, (in which ſence ſome are called ſheep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16.) therefore to prevent this evaſion, the Apoſtle addes the meanes by which they come to have this righteouſneſſe of God upon them, which is by faith; though it had been enough to have ſaid that it was upon them that believe; yet to put this matter out of doubt, he addes thoſe words, that it is by faith; And if it bee by faith, then not before faith; but if it is by faith, as the Apoſtle affirmes, therefore not before faith; If faith were a condition conſequent to our juſtification, not antecedent, it could not bee ſaid to be by faith. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. The Lord puts a double condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning our deliverance out of trouble, one antecedent <hi>(call upon me)</hi> another conſequent <hi>(and thou ſhalt glorifie me,)</hi> in the midſt of which two, ſtands the deliverance promiſed; ſo as the order is; firſt, we muſt call; ſecondly, then God delivers; and then thirdly, we muſt glorifie him; now if our faith were a condition only conſequent to our juſtification, then it ſtands in no other place in reſpect of juſtification, then doth our glorifying of God, which followes our deliverance out of trouble; and it ſo, then we may as well be ſaid to be delivered by our glorifying of God, which follows our deliverance, as to bee juſtified by faith, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes our juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. From <hi>Num.</hi> 21.7, 8, 9. compared with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14, 15. I reaſon thus, faith hath the ſame place and uſe in our juſtification, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> looking had in their healing; when they were ſtung with the fiery Serpents; but they were not firſt healed and then to look and ſee what it was that had healed them; but they were firſt to look upon the Brazen Serpent, and then by looking were healed; ſo it is here with us, Chriſt is lift up on high for us to look unto, this looking is by faith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14, 15. and by this looking we are healed, and ſaved, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.22.</p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:113533:152"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Look what place works had for our juſtification to life in the Covenant of works, the ſame place hath faith in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace; but works were to goe before our juſtification in the Covenant of works, and therefore ſo muſt faith in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; Though <hi>Adam</hi> was by nature juſt, by an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall juſtice yet he was not thereby actually juſtified unto life; but beſides his native or habituall righteouſneſſe, he muſt alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme an actuall righteouſneſſe; and without this he was not to be juſtified unto life; and if he was not to be juſtified without or before works, then are not we juſtified without or before faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe faith is to us in ſtead of works, and hath the ſame place now in the Covenant of grace, as works had then in the Covenant of works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ</hi> 5. To make faith a condition conſequent to our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to place faith in the ſame ranke with works, as works are conſidered in the Covenant of grace; for even works alſo have a place in the Covenant of grace; though they are not a condition antecedent, yet are they a condition conſequent to our juſtification, ſo as every juſtified perſon muſt walk in good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7.8. And therefore if faith be placed after juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then it ſtands but in the ſame rank with works having no propriety or pre-eminence above works, in reſpect of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: For though it ſhall be granted that faith goes before works as the cauſe be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore the effect, faith producing works, as the tree doth the fruit; yet they are both alike in reſpect of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; they are one before another, when they are compared betwixt themſelves; but compare them both with juſtification, and then (according to this opinion) they goe both together; no more is aſcribed to faith in our juſtification then to works, if faith follow our juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. We are not actually juſtified till Chriſt be actually ours, Chriſt being our righteouſneſſe before God; but Chriſt is not actually ours till he be received by us; nor is he received but only by faith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. Chriſt muſt be received by us, or wee have no benefit by him unto ſalvation; Chriſt is righteouſneſſe <hi>for us</hi> before our faith; but he is not righteouſneſſe <hi>unto us,</hi> till he bee received of us by faith; our garments are prepared for us, before we be cloathed with them, but that they may actually
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:113533:152"/> cloath and cover us, we muſt take them by the hand, and put them on, ſo muſt we receive Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. which is done by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. though he be fit to juſtifie us before faith, yet he doth not actually juſtifie us, or cover our ſinfull nakedneſſe, till by the hand of faith, we take him, and put him on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. That righteouſneſſe which is by imputation, cannot be before that which is imputed to us as our righteouſneſſe; but the righteouſneſſe which the Covenant of grace ſets forth, is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by imputation, and it is faith which is imputed for righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> 3.6. and therefore our righteouſneſſe cannot be before our faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ</hi> 8. If we were juſtified before faith, then the witneſſe of the Spirit of bondage, witneſſing our bondage under ſin and death, could not be true; for till faith come, he teſtifies unto us that wee are under wrath, unjuſt, ſinners; and this witneſſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is true; and therefore till wee believe, wee are not juſtified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 9. Laſtly, (to omit other reaſons, which might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,) if juſtification were before faith, we might then ask as the Apoſtle doth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. What is the preferment of faith? what profit hath the believer above the unbeliever? they are both alike in reſpect of juſtification before God; when a man comes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, hee is not a pin the better then he was before he believed, but was juſtified before, as well as after; and thus faith, which is called precious faith, is made vile, and of little worth, ſeeing a man may be juſtified without it, as well as with it.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the third thing propounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the condition of the Covenant; namely, what the condition of it is, <hi>ſc.</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth point follows, which is, whether the putting of a condition, doth or can ſtand with the free grace of the Covenant, yea or no? for it may ſeeme that if there be any condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on our part, then the grace of the Covenant is not free; and if not free, then its no grace at all, and how then is it called a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The putting of a condition doth not hinder or leſſon the free grace of the Covenant, ſo long as the condition is Evangelicall and not Legall.</p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:113533:153"/>
               <p>Some have beene of minde, that the promiſes which we call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall are not free promiſes, or promiſes of free grace, and therefore they make an oppoſition betwixt the promiſes which are called abſolute and the conditionall, as if only the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were free promiſes, excluding the conditionall; but the condition annexed (being a condition of the Goſpel, not of the Law) doth no more derogate from the freeneſſe of grace, then a Princes offering a royall reward to a Subject upon condition that he doe thankfully accept of it, and acknowledge his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounty towards him, doth any whit derogate from the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the gift; no more doth the condition of faith, by which we receive the grace given unto us of God, derogate from the freeneſſe of his grace towards us; a legall condition doth indeed exclude free grace; but an Evangelicall condition doth not; When the Lord ſaith, <hi>Believe and thou ſhalt bee ſaved, Act.</hi> 16.31. and ſaith alſo, <hi>by grace yee are ſaved, Eph.</hi> 2.8. There is the like free grace in both; <hi>Believe and be ſaved,</hi> though conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, is as free grace, as if ſaid, Thou ſhalt be ſaved by grace freely loving thee, and pardoning thy ſinne. That theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall promiſes are of free grace, as well as the abſolute, I prove; becauſe,</p>

And look in what ſeries and order God did purpoſe to communicate the bleſſings of grace to his Elect, ſo as one ſhall ſucceed and follow the other, the ſame doth he make known in his promiſe, and ſo doth alſo execute and fulfill; firſt calling, then juſtifying, then glorifying &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, 29 30. hee doth not ſave till he call and juſtifie; but firſt he calls to faith, and juſtifies, and then glorifieth him that believeth: And here though the giving of life to him that believeth, be conditionall and followes the giving of faith: yet is the giving of life as free grace as the giving of faith, both one and other ſpringing from the ſame
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:113533:153"/> fountaine, even from the purpoſe of his grace, by which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed firſt to call unto faith, and then by faith, to bring unto life and ſalvation: ſo that the adding of a condition doth not abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate the freeneſſe of grace promiſed, but only ſhews in what order and way we muſt expect the bleſſing, one bleſſing of the Covenant of life going before, another following; the former being conditions to the latter, faith a condition of ſalvation; but both faith and ſalvation ſpringing from the ſame purpoſe of Grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe conditionall promiſes are promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and therefore alſo promiſes of free grace; either theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are promiſes of free grace, or elſe the Goſpel is not a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of free grace: It is the Goſpel only, and not the Law, which ſaith, <hi>Believe and be ſaved:</hi> The Law never made promiſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, upon ſuch a condition; If then theſe conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, bee promiſes of the Goſpel, then they are promiſes of free Grace, or elſe the Goſpel is not a Doctrine of free Grace.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Now whereas ſome Galathian (that mixed faith and the works of the Law together, in point of juſtification) might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſay, that a man might be juſtified by faith, and yet bee juſtified by the Law alſo, becauſe the Law commands faith, and therefore juſtification by faith, and juſtification by the Law commanding faith may ſtand together; Hereto the Apoſtle anſwers, by denying that which is ſuppoſed; Namely, that the Law commands faith, affirming the plaine contrary, the Law is not of faith; Its not a Doctrine teaching or commanding faith. Hereto alſo agrees theſe words of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. Where the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth between the Law of works and the Law of faith; by the Law of works, underſtanding the morall Law: by the Law of faith, underſtanding the Goſpel; the morall Law is called the Law of works, becauſe it commands works; the Goſpel is called the Law of faith, becauſe it commands faith; Here are two diſtinct Lawes, having two diſtinct commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as two diſtinct conditions of the two Covenants; each of theſe ſeverall commandements, muſt be referred to their own Law commanding them; not works to the Law of faith, nor faith to the Law of works: but works to the Law of works, and faith to Law of faith, that is, the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But by this meanes, if we make the Goſpel a law to command, we ſhall perhaps ſeeme to joyn hands with the Papiſts, making Chriſt another <hi>Moſes,</hi> another Law-giver, to give us a new Law as they uſe to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Popiſh dung of making Chriſt a Law-giver, in that ſence, as they meane, <hi>ſc.</hi> to give us a Law of greater perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was, thereby to juſtifie our ſelves by a more perfect righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. we deteſt and abhorre; and yet neither muſt we deny Chriſt to be a Law-giver, unleſſe we will both deny plaine Scripture (which gives him that title, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.22.

                  <hi>Iames</hi> 4.12.) and deprive him of his Kingly Office, making him no King; though therefore Chriſt be not a Law-giver to give a Law of works to juſtifie our ſelves by it, yet he is a Law-giver to give us a law of Faith, commanding us to believe, and giving us alſo a law of obedience and ſubjection, in doing whereof we muſt teſtifie our love and thankfulneſſe unto God. Thus then the Goſpel being a law of faith, diſtinguiſhed againſt the law of works, the commandement to believe cannot belong to the law of works, but to the Goſpel, which is the law of Grace: And hereto agrees that alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. with verſe 5. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Apoſtleſhip, and being put apart to preach (not the law, but) the Goſpel of God, he ſhews the end of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that obedience might be given unto the faith, that is, that the Doctrine of Faith being made known, and the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Faith publiſhed, men might be brought to ſubmit to that Doctrine of Faith revealed. It is the Goſpel then which calls for this obedience of Faith, as the Apoſtles own words import.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Out of the ſame place, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2. I argue thus, That which <hi>doth exclude</hi> glorying or boaſting, cannot be commanded in that Law which <hi>doth not exclude</hi> boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting: But faith doth exclude boaſting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. The Law of works doth not exclude boaſting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2. and therefore faith cannot be commanded in that Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith ſtands in reference and relation unto Chriſt, looking to him, and reſting upon him for ſalvation, therefore called the faith of Chriſt, and faith in his name, &amp;c. Chriſt is the proper object of Faith, as it juſtifies and ſaves whence it followes, that if the law doe command faith, it muſt of neceſſity ſet forth Chriſt alſo, as the object or foundation on which it is to reſt: The act cannot bee without the object; nor Faith, without Chriſt might be, though there were no Faith in men to believe on him. But Faith cannot be, but it muſt have Chriſt to reſt on: There is no believing to ſalvation without Chriſt; nor can the law therefore command us to believe unto life, but it muſt ſhew us Chriſt on whom we muſt pitch our Faith; <hi>But this the law doth not.</hi> Chriſt is only revealed by the Goſpel, not by the law; the Law knows him not; <hi>Adam</hi> in his beſt eſtate knew not Chriſt, and yet <hi>Adam</hi> had then the knowledge of the whole
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:113533:155"/> law, and of all that the law required: The law then not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing Chriſt, cannot command faith, becauſe faith cannot bee without Chriſt, who is the object which it is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If it bee ſaid that the law is a Schoole-maſter to lead us unto Chriſt, and therefore the Law reveales Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, if we take the law for the morall law, then its bringing of us to Chriſt, is only occaſionall, in as much as it drives us from it ſelfe, as making us to ſee that by it there is no hope of life; it curſeth all, it gives hope of life to none; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhewing us a ſalvation to be had in Chriſt, now the Law by the ſeverity of it, is an occaſion unto us of ſeeking life where it is to bee found: But to bring us to Chriſt, is no proper work of the law. It is no otherwiſe then as if a child knowing the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of his Fathers love, and finding his Schoole-maſter to be very ſevere, and ſharp, runnes from the ſeverity of his Maſter, to hide himſelfe under his Fathers wing, yet not by the teaching or bidding of his Maſter, but his ſeverity is the occaſion of it; ſo it is in the point in hand.</p>
               <p>But if we take the Law for the Law Ceremoniall, Its true, that the Ceremoniall law points out Chriſt unto us, but the, Ceremoniall law was Goſpel in the ſubſtance of it, though vailed over with types and ſhadowes, which were to continue till the body was come; How the carnall minded Jewes miſunderſtood thoſe ceremonies, it matters not: Its certaine that in the primitive inſtitution of them, they were ordained for Evangelicall ends, and therefore this infringeth not the truth before laid downe; namely, that the law, <hi>ſc.</hi> the law of works properly ſo called, doth not reveale Chriſt; and therefore cannot command faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If faith be commanded not in the Goſpel, but in the law, then unbeliefe is no ſinne againſt the Goſpel, but only againſt the law; for where there is no commandement or law to bind, there is no tranſgreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. ſo that if the Goſpel have no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to command us to believe, then not to believe, is no ſinne againſt the Goſpel; and if ſo, then thoſe that have had the Goſpel preached unto them all their life long, ſhall lie under no more guilt of ſinne, then thoſe that never had any more then the law only.</p>

                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:113533:155"/>5. If our calling be by the Goſpel, not by the law, then the commandement which commands faith, is a commandement of the Goſpel, not of the law; our faith is wrought by our calling, our calling is by the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. and therefore the commandement of faith, is a commandement of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Our calling and Faith alſo, is wrought by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, yet not by the commandement, but by the promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is by the commandement, though we exclude not the promiſe; the commandement is indeed made more alluring, more drawing by the promiſe annexed; but the very name, and terme of calling, imports that it is not wrought without the commandement; and therefore it is that we have theſe and the like voyces and commandements of Gods calling unto us, <hi>Come unto me, Return unto me, Come out from among them Separate your ſelves, and I will receive you:</hi> Are not theſe ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God? and by theſe the Lord inclines and drawes the heart to come unto him. In <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.5. there are the words of God the Father unto Chriſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt call a Nation</hi> (ſaith the Father unto him) <hi>and they ſhall runne unto thee:</hi> But what voyce is that by which Chriſt ſhall call the Nation that comes unto him? The Prophet tells us, in verſ. 1.3. <hi>Come to the waters yee that thirſt,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Come unto mee and I will make a Covenant with you:</hi> Theſe commandements backed with promiſes doe draw, and make the Nation ſo called to come to Chriſt, and runne after him; ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Return O backſliding I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus it was with thoſe Bretheren, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.19, 21. and with <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican, whom Chriſt called from the receit of Cuſtome, <hi>Matt.</hi> 9. <hi>Follow me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to him; he ſaid no more, <hi>but preſently hee riſeth up, and followes him, Matth.</hi> 9.9. And thus uſually, <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>follow me, believe on me, &amp;c.</hi> which commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements being accompanied with a Spirit of grace going with them, the ſoule follows Chriſt, to apprehend that grace to which it is called: The ſumme of this argument, is this, that if there be a commandement concurring to our calling, then there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:113533:156"/> concurring to the working of our faith; and if our calling be by the Goſpel, then the commandement by which we are called to faith, is a commandement of the Goſpel, and not of the Law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23. This (ſaith the Apoſtle) is his commandement that we believe in the name of his Son Ieſus Chriſt; Here is a direct commandement to believe; Is this a legall commandement? the whole Epiſtle breathes nothing but a ſpirit of grace, and of the Goſpel; many paſſages in the Epiſtle might be noted for the confirmation thereof; but I am loth to ſpend time in a thing ſo cleare.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The commandements of the law, wound and kill as it is in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. they doe not heale, nor give life; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of believing doth heale and give life to thoſe that are wounded. How many dying ſoules have been raiſed to life? how many wounded conſciences have bin eaſed and healed by that ſweet invitation, and drawing commandement of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Come unto me all yee, &amp;c? Matth.</hi> 11.28. This comming is all one with believing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. and the commandement to come, is a commandement to believe; and will any ſay, this is a legall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement? then could it never have healed and given life, as it hath done; for the law woundeth, but healeth not; The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſweetneſſe which is in this invitation, ſhews of what nature it is; not legall, but Evangelicall. In <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.49. when Jeſus had called <hi>Bartimeus To come unto him,</hi> thoſe about him ſpeak encouragingly unto him <hi>Be of good comfort</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for he calleth thee;</hi> there is comfort in the very call, invitation, or command of Chriſt <hi>To come unto him;</hi> It encourageth us to come; it ſhews us that it is his will we ſhould come unto him, and that he is willing to receive ſuch as come, and will not caſt them away, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. But the Law makes us to flie from God, and to ſtand afarre off, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. The Goſpel only draws us and brings us unto God. This commandement therefore, <hi>Come unto me,</hi> that is, believe in me, being ſo alluring and drawing as it is, muſt needs be a commandement not of the law, but of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If the law do command faith in Chriſt, then it commands things contrary; as namely, to look for life by our own perſonall working, and to look for life not by our own working, but by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:113533:156"/> That law which binds us to perſonall fulfilling of it; doth not alſo ſend us to another to have it fulfilled in him; but the law commands us perſonall obedience, to fulfill the commandements in our own perſons; It urgeth us thus, <hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt love, <hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt not luſt, <hi>Thou thy ſelfe</hi> muſt fulfill all theſe things, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for thee; but faith looks for theſe things to be done for us by another, and therefore cannot be commanded in the Law: By the law the righteouſneſſe of the righteous ſhall be upon himſelf, and <hi>the man</hi> that doth theſe things ſhall live in them; but by faith the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is upon others, even upon thoſe that doe believe, faith therefore is not commanded in the Law.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That which confounds the two Covenants, is not to bee admitted; but that the commandement commanding faith is a commandement of the law, doth confound the two Covenants, Law, and Goſpel; and therefore is not to be admitted as true. If the commandement commanding faith be a commandement of the law, this muſt needs make a confuſion betwixt Law and Goſpel, ſo as theſe two ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now that by this opinion this confuſion muſt of neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When a promiſe is annexed to a commandement, the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and promiſe are ever of the ſame kind, either both Legall, or both Evangelicall; The nature and kind of the promiſe doth depend upon and follow the nature and kind of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which goes before it; The quality of the commandement, doth qualifie, and diſtinguiſh the promiſe annexed, to make it either Legall or Evangelicall For when the Lord ſaith, <hi>doe this and live,</hi> and when he ſaith, <hi>believe in Chriſt and live;</hi> the life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed is for ſubſtance one and the ſame, in both promiſes; yet theſe promiſes do differ, becauſe the commandement which goes before as the condition of the promiſe, is different in the one and in the other, <hi>Doing,</hi> being a Legall commandement, <hi>Believing,</hi> being Evangelicall; the ground therefore of difference in the promiſes is from the diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rence of the command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ment; which is the condition of the promiſe; ſo that when its ſaid, <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> Here the promiſe of life is legall, becauſe the commandement of doing
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:113533:157"/> is legall; on the other ſide, when its ſaid, <hi>Believe and live;</hi> here the promiſe of life is Evangelicall, becauſe the commandement of believing is Evangelicall: But if we make the commandement of believing to be legall, then the promiſe of life upon condition of believing, muſt be legall alſo, and then there is no difference left betwixt theſe two, <hi>do and live,</hi> and <hi>believe and live;</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds Law and Goſpel, heaven and earth, and makes the two Covenants all one.</p>
               <p>Papiſts turn the Covenant of grace into a Covenant of works: This doth the contrary, turning the Covenant of works into a Covenant of grace; <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſpeaking of the point of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, brings in <hi>Andradius</hi> his conceit, which is this, That <hi>utraque juſtitia, &amp; Legis &amp; Fidei, &amp;c.</hi> both righteouſneſſes, both the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Law, and the righteouſneſſe of Faith, doth conſiſt in <hi>obſervatione Legis,</hi> in the obſervation of the Law; only with this difference, that when the Law is fulfilled by the unregenerate, then it is <hi>juſtitia Legis,</hi> the righteouſneſſe of the Law; when by the regenerate, then it is <hi>juſtitia Fidei,</hi> the righteouſneſſe of Faith. Like hereto is this Doctrine, that the commandement of faith is a commandement of the Law, for then both Covenants, both Law and Goſpel, muſt ſtand in <hi>obſervatione fidei,</hi> in the duty of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; only perhaps the maintainers of this opinion will make a difference thus, That that faith which is wrought by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, is the faith of the law or Covenant of works, and that faith which is wrought by the promiſe, is the faith of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: But as he, notwithſtanding his diſtinction of men regenerate and unregenerate, doth in effect confound both Covenants, changing the Covenant of grace into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works: So doe theſe, notwithſtanding their diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of commandement and promiſe; they confound both Covenants, changing the Covenant of works (which ſtands in doing) into a Covenant of grace, (which ſtands in believing) and ſo by this Doctrine one of the principall differences betwixt the two Covenants, is taken away, the one requiring works, the other faith, the one doing, the other believing.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This is confirmed further by that which is ſpoken of our Saviour Chriſt in <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.14, 15. where it is ſaid of him, that he came preaching the Goſpel, (not the Law, but the Goſpel)
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:113533:157"/> and ſaying, <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel;</hi> here the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believe, is directly called a preaching of the Goſpel, and therefore it is a commandement of the Goſpel, and not of the Law.</p>
               <p>Other Reaſons might be added, as namely, if faith be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the law, then a man may be ſaved by a work of the Law, and cannot be ſaved without it; Secondly, That this opinion makes the righteouſneſſe of the law, and the righteouſneſſe of faith to be all one, if faith be a duty of the law, &amp;c. Thirdly, What the law commands it commands it as a work; but faith is not requird as a work, being everywhere in the Goſpel oppoſed to working; But theſe I paſſe by, the other may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Thus farre then we are come, that the putting of faith as a condition of life in the Covenant of grace, doth no whit derogate from the freeneſſe of grace.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the gift of faith flows from the ſame purpoſe of grace towards us, as life it ſelfe doth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe faith is an Evangelicall grace of the Goſpel, not of the Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I adde this alſo, that it derogates nothing from grace, becauſe faith receives all the bleſſings of ſalvation promiſed, only from the hand of grace alone; we acknowledge no ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as by which we might receive life from the hand of juſtice, as putting a price into our hand to be a meritorious cauſe of life; ſuch a condition could not indeed ſtand with grace; but the condition we put, is both received by grace, is by grace wrought in us, and doth alſo receive all from grace, and therefore doth nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the grace of the Covenant: The Apoſtle cleares this, in that one ſhort ſpeech of his in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>ye are ſaved by grace through faith:</hi> There is firſt the maine bleſſing of the Covenant, <hi>yee are ſaved;</hi> There is ſecondly, the fountaine or cauſe of it, <hi>(by grace) yee are ſaved by grace;</hi> Then thirdly, there is the condition <hi>(through faith:)</hi> And if any ſhould now ask how it could be by grace, and yet depend upon the condition of faith, the Apoſtle goes on and ſhews how that may be; namely, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe faith is not of our ſelves, but it is the gift of God; and 2. Becauſe faith doth not come to God boaſtingly, to claime life by the works of righteouſneſſe, which we have done;
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:113533:158"/> but comes to him with an empty hand to receive what grace and mercy is willing to give; ſuch a condition as this, doth no more derogate from the freeneſſe of grace, then doth the beggers receiving of the almes given him, derogate from the kindneſſe of him that gave it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The grace of the Covenant is free notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, becauſe we doe not put any condition as antecedent to the Covenant on Gods part, whereby to induce and move the Lord to enter into Covenant with us, as if there were any thing ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in us, which might invite and draw him to take us into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with himſelfe; only we ſuppoſe a condition antecedent to the promiſe of life, which condition we are to obſerve and walk in; and in the obſervation thereof to expect the bleſſing of life which the Covenant promiſeth: If God had not purpoſed to have dealt with us after his rich grace, he might have ſaid to us (when he ſaw us polluted in our bloud,) <hi>I will no more have mercy,</hi> as it is in <hi>Hoſeah</hi> 1.6, 9. <hi>ye ſhall no more be my people, neither will I be yours:</hi> But yet he is pleaſed to over-look all our ſinfull pollutions, and to ſprinkle clean water upon us, and then to take us by the hand and to enter into Covenant with us: here is grace free, notwithſtanding the condition of faith to which the promiſe is made.</p>
               <p>In a word, The Lord out of his free grace purpoſing life and ſalvation to his choſen, then to make way for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his purpoſe in bringing us to life, firſt, he works in us renewing grace, and puts within us a ſpirit of faith, and ſo leads us on in the way of faith, to the obtaining of that great bleſſing, the ſalvation promiſed; the one of theſe being antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and as a condition to the other.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vſes.</hi> And firſt from this, that faith is the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; from whence, firſt, we may conceive how it is that even in the Covenant of grace, life is promiſed unto good works, and to well-doing; as it is in <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.29. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18, 19. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. by all which it might ſeeme that works have the ſame place in the Covenant of grace, as in the Covenant of works, even to be proper cauſes of ſalvation; but where we finde the promiſe of life made unto good works, we muſt not look at them as works of the Law, but as works and fruits of faith wrought by a beleever, wrought forth by the power and by the life of faith, which being a living grace, cannot be idle and fruitleſſe, but will be working, and fruitfull in well doing. Theſe kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (which promiſe life unto works) are (if I may ſo call them) not caſuall, but declarative, making manifeſt who be thoſe true beleivers to whom the life promiſed in the Covenant doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: In theſe promiſes workes are not ſet as the cauſes of our ſalvation, but as evidences and ſignes of thoſe that do beleeve unto life; diſtinguiſhing betwixt beleevers and unbeleevers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe that are ſincerely faithfull, and ſeeming profeſſors, which profeſſe and ſay they beleive, but indeed their faith is but a dead faith, and therefore vaine; the promiſe is made to works not as the cauſe of our ſalvation, but to note out the nature and quality of that faith which is the condition of life; ſeeing faith is a grace more inward, and that act of it by which it ſaveth, is ſecret and cannot be ſeen, (for who knows our reſting on or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering unto Chriſt?) therefore this ſaving faith ſhews it ſelfe by ſome other acts of it, ſetting love a worke, which diſcovers it ſelfe by obedience in all righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe; and theſe fruits being ſeen do make knowne the tree from whence they come; although therefore the promiſe of life is made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to faith, ſometimes to workes, yet this is not to note out a twofold condition of the Covenant, as if the condition were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, and partly works; but to note out the property and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that faith, which hath the promiſe of life belonging to it; not an idle but a working faith, not a dead faith but living; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, in word or tongue only, but operative and effectuall, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us carefull to ſhew forth good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8. Otherwiſe if
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:113533:159"/> we look at workes by themſelves as ſeparated from faith, to ſuch works there is no promiſe of life made in the Covenant of grace; The ſame work done by a beleever hath a promiſe of reward, and the ſame work being done by an unbeleever hath no promiſe; which ſhews that the promiſe is made rather to the worker, or to the beleever thus working, then to the worke it ſelfe; and by this meanes the promiſe of life being made to this kinde of faith which doth thus work; hereby the faithfull are enabled the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee their own eſtate in the promiſe of life, as having a good foundation (of aſſurance) thereby, that they ſhall obtaine eternall life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. hereby alſo carnall profeſſors who talk of ſaith, but have no works, walking unholily, are convinced to have no part and right thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This may let us ſee the kindneſſe and love of God towards us, in that he hath appointed ſuch a condition of life unto us, as through his grace is poſſible for us to fulfill; To fullfill the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Law is now become impoſſible, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of our fleſh; but it is not impoſſible to beleeve on him who hath fulfilled all righteouſneſſe for us. Here is grace in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſuch a poſſible condition; for though the Lord ſhould have fully pardoned all our former breaches of Covenant with him, and ſhould have ſaid unto us, you have once broken my Covenant, and yet if you will at laſt fulfill my Law which I gave unto you, I will yet accept you as juſt unto life: yet we could not have done it, the condition was too hard for us to perform; If we had been held cloſe to this condition of fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Law, we ſhould have miſſed of life for ever: The Lord therefore ſeeing and pittying of our infirmity, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to propound unto us another condition, ſaying unto us, only beleive; Beleive on my ſon, truſt on my grace, and thou ſhalt be ſaved; herein the Lord hath condeſcended to our weakneſſe, taking compaſſion of our infirmities, laying upon us no other burthen but this; Beleeve my promiſe, accept my grace, and reſt upon it, and this thy faith ſhall ſave thee, Thou ſhalt never periſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſerves for comfort to all Gods faithfull ones, that have beleived through grace; if you have received this firſt gift, if it be given you to beleeve, you ſhall not fail of a ſecond gift, even the gift of eternall life through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:113533:159"/> Though your repentance be leſſe then to equall the meaſure of your ſins, though your obedience be imperfect, yea, though your faith it ſelfe be weak alſo, yet if it be <gap reason="foreign">

Here are three witneſſes from heaven and earth, all witneſſing the bleſſed eſtate of ſuch as do beleive.</p>
               <p>Faith is well termed precious faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes us partakers of all the precious bleſſings of grace, which are contained in the Covenant; The faithfull are inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritours of all the priviledges which God hath promiſed to his choſen, and therefore it is that they are called heires of promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17: and heires of bleſſing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p>You beleevers, be exhorted to ſee and owne your bleſſedneſſe, take notice of the great things the Lord hath done for you, he hath made a covenant with you, even a Covenant of peace, and bleſſing, and life for ever; God is become your God, he will be all things unto you; and when all helpes under heaven fail you, yet from himſelfe he will do you good; all your ſins are forgiven you, his ſpirit is yours to lead you, to ſanctifie you, and to heal the evils that be in you; he will uphold you in that ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſtand, and will keep you that you ſhall never periſh, and will at laſt bring you to a full injoyment of himſelfe in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdome, where you ſhall for ever bleſſe him, and be made bleſſed by him, and ſhall rejoyce before him with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and glorious; pluck up your hearts therefore and be glad, lift up your heads, ſtrengthen the weak hands, and the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knees, ſerve the Lord with gladneſſe and joyfulneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, conſidering the day of our ſalvation draweth neer; though now for a time you may be in heavineſſe, through manifold temptations and afflictions in this evill world, yet faint not, you being partakers of that precious faith, you have the holy and faithfull God in Covenant with you, to love you, to bleſſe you, and to ſave you; and yet a little while and he that ſhall come
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:113533:160"/> will come, and receive you to himſelfe, and then you ſhall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what it is to have beleived, and to have been in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, what it is to have God to be your God, when you ſhall ſee him and enjoy him as he is; Only nouriſh your faith, and live by faith, make much of this precious grace; cheriſh it by thinking often on the promiſes, and of that grace which hath been ſhewed upon you from on high; ſtudy to walke worthy of that mercy received, and in ſo doing, wait for the end of your faith, the ſalvation of your ſoule.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If faith be the condition of the Covenant, then woe to all unbeleevers, that go on in their impenitency and unbeleife: Their unbeleife deprives them of that good which the Lord hath by his Covenant promiſed to his people; they have no part nor portion in God; they are without God, without Chriſt, without Covenant, without promiſe, without mercy, their ſins are unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, they are under the curſe, the wrath of God abides upon them, there is nothing to take it away from them, but if they abide in unbeleif, wrath abides upon them for ever. There is a wrath wherby God is angry with his own people, but that anger laſts but for a little ſeaſon, it is but for a moment, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.7, 8. it paſſeth away and abides not upon them; but the unbeleiver hath wrath abiding on him for ever; <hi>John</hi> 3.36. In <hi>Iude</hi> 5. it is ſaid that God afterwards deſtroyed thoſe Iſraelites that beleived not; when once they had had the means of grace made known, then not beleiving, God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deſtroyed them; you that tread in the ſteps of their unbeleif, you are little troubled to thinke what miſery is comming upon you, as not knowing that you are in danger; but you are under wrath, your judgement haſtneth, and your damnation ſleepeth not; be awakened therefore, be thinke your ſelves, and conſider what your end will be; by your unbeleif you put a bar to exclude your ſelves from the bleſſing of life promiſed to Gods people; you thus continuing, the Lord neither <hi>will,</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> ſave you. You will thinke this an hard ſaying, but you will finde it too true, God cannot lye, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.2. much leſſe can he forſwear; but God hath ſworne this, that ſuch <hi>ſhall never enter into his reſt, Pſal.</hi> 95. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> In <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> Its ſaid Chriſt <hi>did not</hi> many great works in his owne country, <hi>for their unbeleifes ſake:</hi> But in <hi>Marke</hi> 6.5. its ſaid hee <hi>could not</hi> doe them, he
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:113533:160"/> neither did them nor could do them; unbeleif ſtops the courſe and diverts the ſtream of Gods goodneſſe from comming unto us; Chriſts uſuall ſpeech to thoſe that expected any bleſsing from him was this, <hi>According to your faith be it unto you;</hi> faith makes all things poſſible, <hi>Marke</hi> 6.23. It will reverſe the ſentence of death which is paſſed upon us, and bring us back unto life; but unbeleife makes it impoſſible ſo that we cannot be ſaved; The Lord can do nothing againſt his own counſell and will, and he hath concluded this with himſelfe, to ſave none but ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, and that whoſoever beleeveth not ſhall periſh; all you unbeleevers conſider this, your unbeleefe will bee your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Is there ſuch a work of faith in bringing us into Covenant with God, and in enabling us to walk in Covenant with him?</p>
               <p n="1">1. This ſerves to direct all the people of God, how to live and walke before God; look at your ſelves as ſuch as have God in Covenant with you to bleſſe you with all bleſſings meet and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt for you, whether they be bleſſings of this life or that which is to come; you are no more ſtrangers and forreiners, you are not aliens from the Covenant or common-wealth of Iſrael; All the good which God hath promiſed to his <hi>Iſrael</hi> belongs to you; Live therefore a life of faith, reſting upon the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you. Naturall men live by ſence and reaſon; live you by faith in Gods Covenant and promiſe; and there is much uſe to be made of this conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In caſe we have ſinned, and done things that we ſhould not, and thereby have grieved the Lord as <hi>David</hi> did, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>that the thing that David had done diſpleaſed the Lord;</hi> yet herein make uſe of our faith, truſting ſtill to his grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for forgiveneſſe according to his Covenant; we muſt not now fly away from God and ſtand afar off, or caſt away our hope, as if we had loſt our God, and had no more part or portion in him, but ſtill beleive that we renewing our Repentance before him, he will ſtill be our God, and love us ſtill, and will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to our iniquities. Now is a time to put forth faith in Gods promiſe, we muſt remember we are not under that hard condition of workes, but under the condition of Faith; Its the weakneſſe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:113533:161"/> and ſinfull infirmity of many of Gods people who walk in much diſcouragement of ſpirit becauſe of ſome failings which they ſee in themſelves, by which they become uncomfortable to themſelvs and to others, when yet their conſcientious walking and tendernes is manifeſt to all; ſuch a diſcouraged ſpirit might well become a childe of the Law, that is under the condition of Workes; but it becomes not ſuch as are under the condition of Faith; Hath the Lord ſaid that if his people ſin againſt him, after hee hath taken them into Covenant with himſelfe, he will caſt them off and acknowledge them no more? See what <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpeaks to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.19, 20. <hi>Ye have indeed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great ſin, and done all this wickedneſſe, yet feare not, depart not from following the Lord, for the Lord will not forſake his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> The Lord know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> our frailty, and remembers we are but duſt; and therefore hath told us, <hi>that he will ſpare us as a father ſpareth his ſon that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rveth him, Mal.</hi> 3.17. and will be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our ſins. If we were or could be without ſin, we ſhould not have needed ſuch promiſes of forgiveneſſe; but when the Lord tooke us into Covenant with himſelfe, he knew we ſhould ſtill need daily mercy and compaſſion to heale our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings; and foreſeeing our need of ſuch promiſes, he hath made them knowne unto us that we might live by them, looking up unto him by faith in the fence of our daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, for a gracious acceptance of us, and forgiveneſſe of our ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe we want any bleſſing, (ſuppoſe ſome ſpeciall grace to enable us to walke more fruitfully in our particular places and callings,) look herein at the Covenant as a ſtorehouſe full of all rich bleſſings, and make uſe of faith which is the condition of the Covenant; ſet that aworke, and draw out of this fountain as much as we need; if we want wiſedome, boldneſſe, meekneſſe, temperance, remember by what means we muſt receive them; we receive the ſpirit by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. beleive this promiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherein the Lord hath ſaid he will give the Holy Ghoſt to them that deſire him, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. This is the way the Saints have taken; <hi>David</hi> when he found his heart defiled with thoſe luſts, what courſe took he to get it cleanſed from theſe impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? he flyes to God by the prayer of faith, deſiring to have a
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:113533:161"/> clean heart created in him; when the Church found her ſelf ſhut up under deadneſſe and hardneſſe of heart, they fly for help to Gods Covenant, <hi>Thou art our father, and we are thy people, Breake not thy covenant with us,</hi> Iſai. 63. and 64. Ier. 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In caſe we be troubled with feares of Apoſtacy and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding, as thinking though we have begun well, yet we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to continue; Perſecutions, diſcouragements, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſo many, ſo violent, that we thinke we ſhall never ſtand out againſt them; here alſo live by faith, God will give an iſſue to all our temptations; in the mean time commit our ſoules to God in well doing, and beleeve as <hi>Paul</hi> did, that he will deliver you from every evill work, and preſerve you blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to his heavenly Kingdome, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. If Satan annoy with his temptations, ſay as <hi>Jehoſhua</hi> did, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee O Satan, Zach.</hi> 3. and remember the promiſe, <hi>The Lord will ſhortly tread him under our feet,</hi> Rom. 16.</p>
               <p n="4">4, In caſe of any ſervice or duty to be performed unto God, remember his Covenant, <hi>I will make you able to keepe my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to doe them, Ezek.</hi> 36.27. In 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.26. it is ſaid, <hi>God helped the Levites in bearing the Arke;</hi> ſo will he help us to undergoe the burthen of that work which is too heavy for us, if we reſt upon him by faith, if we have a word of faith to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us that the work to be done, is (for the generall) <hi>Gods worke,</hi> and that it is particularly required of us as <hi>Our works,</hi> a worke of our calling; we have then good warrant to depend upon his help, he hath called us, he hath ſent us to the work, and therefore he will be with us according to that ſpeech of his to <hi>Gideon</hi> in <hi>Judges</hi> 6.14, 16. <hi>I have ſent thee and therefore I will be with thee;</hi> This is written not for him only, but for us alſo, that being called to any miniſtration or ſervice, we might by faith look for the ſame preſence of God with us, the ſame aſſiſtance as he had; Many other particulars might be named, but theſe may ſuffice to give a ſhort direction how to live by faith in the promiſe and Covenant of God, according to the ſeverall occaſions which befall us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As we muſt depend upon God by faith for all good things which the Covenant promiſeth, ſo we muſt remember the other part of the Covenant, That God will be a God over us, as
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:113533:162"/> well as a God to bleſſe us; and therefore here our care muſt be to advance the Lord on high, that it may be ſeen by our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto him, that we doe acknowledge him to be our God, above us and over us; he hath humbled himſelf to take ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings as we are into Covenant with himſelfe, and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by advanced us above our ſelves; our duty is to ſet up him that hath abaſed himſelfe for our ſakes, and to humble our ſelves to walke, with our God, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> that by his faith he gave glory to God; if we be the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> let us herein imitate the work of <hi>Abraham,</hi> give honour to him whom we beleeve to be our God.</p>
               <p>We are all willing to be in Covenant with God thus far, that we may ſet up our ſelves, and climbe up into heaven that there we may ſit upon Thrones, and to poſſeſſe a Kingdome; but we muſt thinke eſpecially of ſetting up the Lord upon his Throne, that he may rule in us, and reign over us, he having for this end taken us to be a people unto himſelfe. <hi>Aſcribe greatneſſe to our God,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) Deut.</hi> 33, 3. make it a name and a praiſe unto him, that he hath vouchſafed to make us his people, and to take us into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him.</p>
               <p>Honour him as he is God, but honour him more abundantly as he is <hi>our God;</hi> we owe this unto him, by the Covenant we have made with him; the world knowes him not, nor honours him not, the wicked contemne God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. and ſhall God have no honour? Shall he that ſtretched out the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and formed man upon it, ſhall he have no glory by all his workes? ſhall he in vain create all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, having none to praiſe him? The Lord himſelfe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.21. This is a people whom I have formed for mine owne praiſe; God <hi>will</hi> have praiſe from his own people, whom he hath taken unto himſelfe, he <hi>will</hi> be glorified in all thoſe that come neer unto him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10 3.

               <p>Hence is that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.18. <hi>The Lord hath ſet thee up this
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:113533:162"/> day to be a precious people unto him,</hi> and in verſe 17. <hi>Thou haſt ſet up the Lord thy God to walke in his wayes, and to keepe his Commandements.</hi> The word which is there tranſlated (avouched) <hi>Pagnine</hi> in his great <hi>Theſaurus</hi> tranſlates <hi>exaltaſti,</hi> Thou haſt ſet up, as doth <hi>Arrius Montanus</hi> alſo; we muſt then ſet up our God on high; Labour to advance him above the heavens; he hath raiſed us above the earth, and above the condition of the men of the earth, that we might fill the world with his glory, and extoll him above all; he hath made it a name and a praiſe unto us, that we are the people in Covenant with him; much more ſhould it be a name and a praiſe unto him, that he hath ſhewed ſuch grace unto the ſons of men, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.11.</p>
               <p>All ſuch therefore as are the faithfull people of God, that are entred into Covenant with him, conſider this duty; take heed of polluting the Name of your God, let not his name and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſuffer by you, but lift up his Name on high, that it may be magnified before all the world.</p>
               <p>And for this end take theſe few directions</p>

If we will honour God and exalt him in due manner, we muſt ſet him up as our cheife and higheſt in our eſteem, far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every name that is named in this world, or that which is to come; ſet none compar with him, none equall unto him; Kings count themſelves not to be honoured with due honour, if they be not ſet up above other men: Its not enough to honour God, but we muſt honour him as God, and that is to ſet him higheſt in our hearts, and above all: Hence it is that the Saints of God have uſed ſuch expreſſions concerning him, as doe ſingle him forth beyond the compariſon of all creatures: Thus <hi>Moſes, Who is like unto thee amongſt the Gods? who is like unto thee, ſo glorious in holineſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. So <hi>David, Thou art great, O Lord, there is none like thee,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.22. So <hi>Solomon, O Lord God of Iſrael, there is none like thee in heaven above, or in the earth beneath,</hi> 1 Kings 8.23. So <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, which paſſeſt by the trangreſſions of the remnant of thine heritage?</hi> Thus have the Saints advanced God, in their eſteem of him, making none like unto him in greatneſſe, in glory, in holineſſe, in goodneſſe, and in mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus we muſt riſe up in our thoughts and apprehenſions of God, till we come to a holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:113533:163"/> and admiration of him, carried beyond the limits of all created excellency, ſo as to eſteeme all things elſe as nothing in compariſon of him, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. There be men that ſay they are gods, and think they are equall with the moſt High, but they are but gods of the earth as the Prophet calls them, (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.11.) but our God is the God of heaven; therefore ſet him on high above all gods; God counts himſelfe debaſed when any are made equall unto him, <hi>Eſay</hi> 46.5, 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Count it our bleſſedneſſe, and higheſt dignity to be a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Covenant with God, that we have him neare unto us in all that we call unto him for, and may live in an holy fellowſhip and communion with; count it our honour that we are his ſervants, and may ſtand before him, and miniſter unto him; <hi>David,</hi> though great in name and dignity, who knew his pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> as well as other men, and who could ſay (when occaſion was) <hi>Doe not I know that I am this day King over Iſrael?</hi> yet took more felicity in being Gods ſervant, then in being King and Ruler over that great people, and therefore he ſpeaks to God in ſuch manner, <hi>O Lord I am thy ſervant, O God, thou art my God, &amp;c.</hi> So then are we honorable as <hi>David</hi> was? yet eſteeme we this as our greateſt honour, that God is our God, and we his ſervants.</p>
               <p>Are we low and deſpiſed in the world? yet count this honour enough that God hath lifted us up to this excellency to be one of his people; And herein the Lord counts himſelfe to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by us, when being counted as things that are not, as <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe is, <hi>even as things of nought,</hi> yet we can ſay with <hi>Jacob, I have enough, becauſe the Lord hath had mercy on me, and hath taken me into Covenant with him to be my God:</hi> When in perſecutions, in wants, in diſtreſſes, we can quiet our ſelves in this, that God is our God, we doe herein beare witneſſe of him, before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, that he is better to us then dignities, riches, and all worldly contentments, that he is enough to thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt count the things of God the greateſt things, his work to be the greateſt work, his ſervice the greateſt buſineſſe of our whole life; yea, to be preferred before life it ſelfe. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was in hand with that great work of God, the re-edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the reformation of things amiſſe in Church
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:113533:163"/> and State, hee looked at this as a great work, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.3. <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith he ſpeaking to them that would have drawn him from it) <hi>a great work to doe, which I may not ſuffer to ceaſe, whiles I come down unto you: Nay, he would not ceaſe this work to ſave his life, Neh.</hi> 6.11. When <hi>David</hi> was giving direction concerning the building of the Temple, <hi>The work is great</hi> (ſaith he); And why great? <hi>becauſe it is not for man, but for the Lord,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.1. and 22.5.</p>
               <p>The men of the world look at their own things as the great things which they muſt attend unto; the things of God, are with them, things of leſſe value; they preferre their own things before the things of Jeſus Chriſt; But thoſe that are the Lords people muſt remember that they have given themſelves unto the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. ſo as they are not their own any more, but the Lords, and to be for themſelves no further then may ſtand with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, no further to ſeek their own things then may be <hi>for</hi> the Lord, and not <hi>againſt</hi> the Lord. Here then firſt we muſt preferre his commandements before the commandements and wills of men, reſolving with the Apoſtles to obey God rather then men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, doe his work in the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>e, not firſt for our ſelves, and then for God, as the manner is, but ſee that God be firſt ſerved, remembring the words of our bleſſed Saviour, that he which loves himſelfe or any other thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> then Chriſt, is not worthy of him. Thirdly, offer our beſt things to God, to be for his ſervice and honour; the beſt of our time, the beſt of our children, the beſt of our ſubſtance; the fat of our wheat and of our wine, muſt be for the Lord. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. Honour God with thy riches, and with the firſt of all thine encreaſe; the firſt are uſually the beſt, and moſt deſired, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.1. And therefore when we give the firſt and beſt unto God, God counteth himſelfe honoured by us; when we bring him the leane and the ſcabbie, the lame, and the blind, things of no worth, the Lord is then deſpiſed in our eyes, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we will honour God as his people ſhould doe, we muſt ſtand for his honour in times of generall declining; when all ſeeme to neglect him, and lay his honour in the duſt: When People, Nations, and Languages, ſhall fall down and worſhip the golden Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> the King ſets up, then to deſpiſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:113533:164"/> the Kings commandement, and to worſhip our God alone, this is indeed to honour him: When we ſhall be forbidden to make prayer unto our God, Then with <hi>Daniel</hi> to have our Window open towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to make our prayer before him, is an honouring of him: When we ſerve him only in times of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Reformation, living in a Land of uprightneſſe, when it is an honour to our ſelves to conforme to thoſe that are faithfull with God, in theſe times its more doubtfull whether we ſeek to honour God, or to honour our ſelves; but in corrupt times of generall Apoſtacy, when the world turns their back upon God, then to cleave to him, and ſtand for his worſhip, then to ſay with <hi>Joſhuah, Let all the world chuſe whom they will ſerve, but I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord;</hi> this is to honour him indeed, and to give him glory before the face of the whole world, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.12, 13, 15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we will exalt God, we muſt reſt upon his help at dead lifts, when all other helps faile us, in greateſt ſtraits, when we know not which way to turn us, when we ſee no help either in heaven or earth, but in him alone; Herein <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> gave glory to God, when he knew not what to doe, then were his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. Thus the three Children, when caſt into the fiery Furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> when thrown into the Lyons Den, yet then they believed that the God whom the ſerved, was able to deliver them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. And thus <hi>Moſes</hi> honoured God at the Red Sea, when all was deſperate in the eye of fleſh and blood; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> by the power of faith then believed a deliverance ſhould come, <hi>Stand ſtill</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſee the ſalvation of God;</hi> God is greatly honoured by us, when we truſt upon him in ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate times.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If we will honour God, we muſt be exceeding carefull to keep our vowes and promiſes, which we have made unto him; walk circumſpectly according to the Covenant we have entred into: We ſee how the Lord ſometimes blames <hi>Iſrael</hi> for deſpiſing his Covenant which they had made with him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.59. we cannot neglect our Covenant with him, but it will argue a neglect of God himſelfe; <hi>Thou haſt deſpiſed me,</hi> ſaith the Lord to <hi>David,</hi> when he had deſpiſed the Commandement which he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to obſerve, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 9.10.</p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:113533:164"/>
               <p>We commonly deale with our promiſes to God, as we doe with thoſe which we make to our little children, we think to pleaſe them with promiſes for the preſent, but neither mind great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what we ſay unto them, nor take any care to performe, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will never remember what we ſay unto them, any longer then whiles we are ſpeaking: But would we deale ſo with our Prince? would not he count it a ſleighting of him, if having bound our ſelves by promiſe to performe ſuch a ſervice to him, we ſhould have no care to performe? Be ſure the Lord will require the promiſes we have made unto him. Haſt thou then opened thy mouth unto the Lord? know thou canſt not goe back, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. Thou canſt not neglect thy promiſe to God, without a neglect of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If we will honour God, we muſt lie under the authority of every <hi>word</hi> of his, and conforme our ſelves to his example, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to become followers of him, in imitating the vertues of God which hee hath ſet before us to walk by: Its a part of that honour which children owe to their parents, to obey their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to imitate their godly example in well doing; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not honour God more, then when we are humbled at his feet, to receive his word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3. ſuffering his word to rule in our hearts, ſo as we dare not goe againſt it in any thing, trembling to ſinne againſt it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66. and when we renounce the manners of the world, ſeeking to become followers of God as deare children, this is to ſet him up as honoured by us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In a word, if we will honour God, we muſt contend in his cauſe with much ſtriving, being zealous for him, and for the defence of his Word, Truth, Goſpel, Kingdome, and whatſoever concerns his honour, not yeelding or giving place one hour, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. not leaving an hoofe behind us, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.26. ſtanding out to the utmoſt, in the things of his Kingdome: And when we have done all that we can do, ſtill magnifie his grace, that he wil vouchſafe to admit ſuch as we be to miniſter unto him, even as <hi>David</hi> did, when as he had ſhewed a great deale of zeale in furniſhing the houſe of God, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his own coſt an hundred thouſand Talents of Gold, and an hundred thouſand Talents of Silver, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.14, and had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtirred up the Princes to be helpfull in the ſame work; yet what
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:113533:165"/> ſaith he after all this, he doth not goe glorying before God, as if he had done ſome great thing for God, but humbling himſelfe, ſaith, <hi>Who am I (O Lord) and what is my people that we ſhould offer in this ſort unto thee?</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14. He thought himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to offer any thing to the great God, and that it was an high dignity and favour done unto him, that God would accept any thing at his hands.</p>
               <p>Thus muſt we ſeek to honour our God, that hath ſo highly honoured us in taking us into Covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And thus much of the condition of the Covenant.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T follows in the fifth place to conſider the Properties of the Covenant, and theſe are foure.</p>
               <p>For it is: Firſt, A free Covenant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſure Covenant.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, An everlaſting Covenant.</p>
               <p>Fourhly, An holy Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a free Covenant, a Covenant of free grace, freely made with us, and freely communicating to us all the bleſſings promiſed in it: The bleſſings made over to us in this Covenant, doe ſpring from nothing in us, but only from grace in God.</p>
               <p>Gods Covenant is not like Covenants which are uſually made among men, in which each party expects ſome benefit from the other; <hi>Abimelech</hi> thought it good to make a Covenant of peace with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe hee ſaw God was with him; If <hi>Iſaac</hi> were againſt him, God would be againſt him too; he could not be an enemy to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but he muſt be an enemy to God; he thinks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its beſt for him, even for his own peace and ſafety, to be
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:113533:166"/> at peace with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to make a Covenant with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.28. The like we ſee in the <hi>Shechemits</hi> that make a Covenant with <hi>Iacob;</hi> but they alledge the reaſon of it; ſhall not their flocks, and their cattle, and ſubſtance bee ours? <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.23. Thus it is in the Covenants of men; but it is otherwiſe in the Covenant which he makes with his people; he looks for no benefit by us in his Covenant with us, but only to communicate good unto us; His Covenant is free, <hi>I will love them freely,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Hoſeah</hi> 14.4. And it is ſo free in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of his entering into Covenant with us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of his performance of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of his entering into Covenant with us, there being nothing in us moving the Lord to take us into Covenant with him, but only his own grace, it is his good pleaſure to love us, and doe us good; though wee come without ſilver, without any thing of worth in us, yet we may come unto him, and be taken into Covenant with him, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1, 3. Hence it is, that when God enters into Covenant with his people, he is ſaid <hi>to give them his Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17.2. for ſo the word is in the originall, <hi>I will give thee my Covenant:</hi> In our tranſlation it is, <hi>I will make my Covenant betwixt mee and thee:</hi> but in the originall, <hi>I will give, &amp;c.</hi> As in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.12. God is ſaid to give the Covenant of the Prieſthood unto <hi>Phineas</hi> as a gift; ſo God gives the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of his grace, unto all that he takes into Covenant with him: Hence alſo are thoſe expreſſions uſed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord ſet his love upon you to take you into Covenant with him, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye were more in number then other people, but becauſe he loved you, and choſe your Fathers;</hi> as noting out the freeneſſe of his love towards them, loving them becauſe he loved them: and the conſtancy of his love towards their Fathers, towards whom he would keep the oath which he had ſworn unto them; this was all the cauſe that moved the Lord to take them into Covenant with him: And hereto agrees that of <hi>Samuel, It pleaſed the Lord to make you his people,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22. That <hi>they</hi> were become the people of God, rather then <hi>Aegyptians, Moabites, Ammonites,</hi> or others, was not for any thing which the Lord ſaw in them more then in other people, but it pleaſed the Lord, it was his good pleaſure to chuſe them, and to make them his people.</p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:113533:166"/>
               <p>This freeneſſe of grace in entering into Covenant with us, may appeare by theſe particulas:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God is firſt in ſeeking after us to draw us into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with himſelfe; wee ſeek not him, but he ſeeks us; we chuſe not him, but he chuſeth us, he loves us firſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.16. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.19. And in this reſpect he is ſaid to be found of thoſe that ſeek not after him, becauſe hee firſt reveales and offers himſelfe in mercy unto us, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But though he be firſt in ſeeking after us, may there not bee ſomething in us to draw his eyes, and heart unto us? the man ſeeks firſt after the unmarried virgin, but there is beauty or dowry which drawes him: But there is no ſuch thing in us, there is no worth in us, he ſees us polluted in our blood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 6. he ſaw us contemptible and vile, ſo as none would regard us, verſ. 5. and yet then doth the Lord take us up, and enters into a Covenant with us, verſ. 8. This unworthineſſe of ours made <hi>Abraham</hi> to wonder when hee heard the Lord ſpeak of making a Covenant with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.3. And this ſame made <hi>David</hi> to break out into that affectionate and admiring demand, <hi>Lord, who am I, that thou ſhouldeſt ſpeak thus unto thy ſervant?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is deſert in us to the contrary, to keep off the Lord from ever owning ſuch a people as we were; yea, though we ſhould have ſought after him: As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our former vile unfaithfulneſſe in that firſt Covenant he made with us, wherein we dealt treacherouſly againſt him, forſaking him and lightly eſteeming the God of our ſalvation, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 32.15. we brake the Tables of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and caſt them away from us; yea, and caſt away the Lord from being our God; the more undeſerved therefore, and more free was that grace which moved the Lord to make a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with us, having been ſo falſe to him in the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The enmity that is in us againſt him, and againſt the things that pleaſe him; we are as contrary unto him, as is darkneſſe to light, and evill to good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. we are a crooked generation, that cannot abide the ſtreight wayes of the Lord; our whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſinfull and corrupt before him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider the time wherein the Lord takes us by the hand to bring us into Covenant with him, and then we ſhall finde that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:113533:167"/> when we are moſt averſe and backward, and have leaſt thought of ever ſeeking after him, then it is that he ſeeks us to take us unto himſelfe. Thus the Lord called <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was perſecuting, raging, breathing out ſlaughter, and threatnings againſt the Lord, and againſt his Saints, then the Lord takes him by the hand, and enters into Covenant with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9 and ſo it was with thoſe mockers, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.13, 37. here were no diſpoſitions and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before on their part, but tree and unexpected grace from God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Compare thoſe that are taken into Covenant with other that are left out (for all are not taken in, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. there be that are without God, without Covenant) and this will alſo make it manifeſt, it is free grace by which any are taken in: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we look upon thoſe that are taken into Covenant, and thoſe that are left, we ſhall finde that there is no difference in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, betwixt one and other; <hi>we have all ſinned, and there is no difference,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, 23. No reaſon therefore in us, why one is taken into Covenant, and not another, but only free grace in God; for if it be not free grace towards them that are taken in, then there is injuſtice and wrong done to thoſe that are left: If there were any worth in thoſe that are taken, there was as much in thoſe that are left, and therefore either it muſt be free grace towards the one, or there is injuſtice and wrong to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other; but what blaſphemous mouth dare impute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe and wrong to the righteous God? he owes nothing to any; he may truly ſay to all men, <hi>I doe thee no wrong, Matth.</hi> 20.13. Thou haſt as much as I owe thee. Both ſorts therefore being in themſelves alike, and no wrong done to thoſe that are left, it muſt needs be free grace in thoſe that are taken in; apply <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As ſometimes there is no difference betwixt one and other; ſo ſometimes God chuſeth the worſe, takes in the more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and leaves thoſe that are better then they, <hi>Paul</hi> a chiefe of ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. Publicans and Harlots, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> poſſeſſed with ſeven Devills; theſe were taken in; and the righteous generation (as they were reputed) which juſtified themſelves, and were juſtified by others, were left and paſſed
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:113533:167"/> by. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.7, 8. The Lord tells the Prophet, that if he would have ſent him to another ſtrange people (as he ſent <hi>Jonah</hi> to the <hi>Ninevites</hi>) they would have hearkned unto him and obeyed him, but the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will not obey thee; and yet for all this God ſent his Prophet to them, and not to the other, to the worſe and not to the better, and ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.23. Thus it is in the communication of himſelf in the Covenant of grace; he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times paſſeth by ſuch as ſeeme better, and takes the worſe, to the end that it might appeare that he reſpects none for any thing that is in them, but that the freeneſſe of his grace might be ſeene in thoſe whom he takes unto himſelfe: This is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle points at, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 27, 28, 29. God chuſeth the fooliſh things of the world, the weak things, baſe and deſpiſed things, things which are not, paſſing by the wiſe, the mighty, and things which are in eſteeme, that all might ſee it is nothing in man, but the grace of God by which we are taken into communion and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the grace of the Covenant is thus free in the making of it, ſo it is alſo in the accompliſhment of it; the bleſſings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are as free grace in the beſtowing, as they were in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing: Not that God is now free to performe or not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, for he cannot but performe that which he hath promiſed: but yet he owes the bleſſing to us in regard of his own promiſe, faithfulneſſe and goodneſſe, not in regard of any worth that is in us; for though there be our obedience of faith intervening and comming between Gods promiſe, and between his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, yet the performance is as free grace as is the promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no ſuch worth in any of our obedience, as to which the bleſſing ſhould be done in a way of juſtice: He cannot deny himſelfe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. nor can he alter the thing which is gone out of his lips, <hi>Pſal</hi> 89.34. otherwiſe, the bleſſing of the Covenant is as well freely given, as it was freely promiſed: And therefore it is that the Prophet ſpeaking of the performance of the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> (but was to be performed to his ſeed) he ſpeaks in this manner, <hi>Thou wilt performe truth unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>and mercy unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>as thou hast ſworn unto our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in old time, Micah</hi> 7.20. Gods truth gives aſſurance that hee will doe it (thou wilt performe truth unto <hi>Jacob</hi>) but yet its
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:113533:168"/> mercy when its performed (thou wilt performe mercy unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> &amp;c.) and thence it is that in <hi>Iude</hi> v. 21. the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the Saints, exhorts them to wait for the <hi>mercy</hi> of the Lord unto eternall life; and in <hi>Rom</hi> 6.23. Life eternall is called a gift, freely given by free grace: and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. we are ſaid to be <hi>heires of the grace of life,</hi> becauſe grace is the cauſe, as well of <hi>our inheriting life,</hi> as of <hi>Gods promiſing;</hi> for though we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Spirit of grace, to renew and ſanctifie us; yet in many things we offend ſtill, ſtanding in need of forgiveneſſe from day to day; and where there is need of forgiveneſſe, there life muſt needs be of grace, and not of merit or works.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons why the Lord would have his Covenant to ſtand upon this foundation of free grace; are theſe</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be a ground of hope to ſuch as ſee themſelves unworthy of acceptance with God; If the grace of the Covenant were not free, ſuch unworthy ones could have no hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the glory of grace to be freely communicated, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come and buy without money:</hi> It darkens the glory of grace, when it is vouchſafed for any benefit received, as <hi>Potiphar</hi> favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> becauſe he ſaw God proſper the things that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.3.4. but where favour is wholly free, there it ſhines forth in the glory of it: and thence it is that when the Lord had made his promiſe to the diſperſed Jewes, concerning their gathering in againe, he tells them that it is not for their ſakes, but for his own name ſake, thereby to maintaine the glory of his free grace towards them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord would have his Covenant to be a Covenant of free grace, that the bleſſing of it might be ſure unto thoſe to whom the promiſe is made: The Lord ſaw the unſtability of the former Covenant of works, the promiſe being made with reſpect to that which was in us, or to be done by us, and ſo would this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant have been alſo, if it had been built upon the like foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore that the bleſſing of it might be ſure, the promiſe is made to depend not upon any thing to be done by us, but upon the free grace of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To enforme us from what hand to expect the bleſſing of life promiſed to us in this Covenant, even from mercy and from grace, not from juſtice; he that will have life, and wring it out
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:113533:168"/> of the hand of juſtice, in ſtead of life ſhall have the wages of death, as his deſerved and juſt reward; See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. It is mercy which the beſt muſt look for at that day.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. This may be a ground of incouragement to ſuch as are (or at leaſt ſeem to themſelves to be) afar off, aliens to God, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to his Covenant; let them draw neer, and ſeek to be partakers of this grace ſo freely offered, the bleſſings whereof are great, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value, yet are they as free as great; in reſpect of greatnes they might ſeem to be above hope, but in reſpect of the freeneſſe of them they are under hope; by this conſideration the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth his people, to ſeek unto him for acceptance, (<hi>Receive us graciouſly, Hoſ.</hi> 14.2.) and if any ſay but alas how can we which have forſaken our God, and gone after our Idols, and done ſuch abominations, be accepted by him? hereto the Lord anſwers, I will love them freely; he looks for no worth in us, for which he ſhould ſhew grace unto us, but only that we muſt accept that which is ſo freely offered.</p>
               <p>Its uſuall with ſuch as moſt deſire and long after grace, to be moſt fearfull and doubtfull of obtaining; Oh, there is ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe in them, how can they hope to finde acceptance with God, they can ſee nothing in themſelves for which God ſhould accept them, and tis true; but though you can ſee <hi>nothing in your ſelves,</hi> yet you may ſee <hi>enough in God;</hi> Looking downward you ſee unworthineſſe in your ſelves; but look upward and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold riches of free grace in God; Grace is never the further off becauſe you can ſee no worthineſſe in your ſelves, nay, the more you diſcerne your ſelves unworthy, the more neer is the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace to be manifeſted in you, if ye truſt unto it; ſay not therefore you are unworthy, thereby nouriſhing diſtruſt in your ſelfe; but ſay rather, though I be unworthy, yet I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelfe to that free grace of God which is vouchſafed to unworthy ones; nay, I ſay more, ſuch as are not unworthy, ſhall never taſte of this mercy and grace of God, its given to none but to unworthy ones: The very thought and opinion of our own worthineſſe dwelling in us, excludes us and cuts off from grace; here is then a prop to our weak faith, this puts a plea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouthes of all dejected ſouls; let them look to this ſweet name of grace, here take hold, here reſt, here caſt anchor, in
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:113533:169"/> this harbour we ſhall be ſafe in the midſt of all ſtormes; and as the Church in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.8. conſidering the greatneſſe of her affliction, ſhee ſaid, <hi>Her hope was periſhed from the Lord;</hi> yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering again how her heart was humbled within her, ſhe re-aſſumes her hope, which before was periſhed; my ſoule (ſaith ſhe) is humbled within me, therefore have I hope; ſhee hoped then even when her hope was periſhed; ſo let us do, when our hope is periſhed in reſpect of any goodneſſe in our ſelves, yet conſidering the free kindneſſe and grace of God, let us ſtir up our hopes and ſay as ſhe did, I have hope becauſe the Lord is gracious, freely offering grace to the unworthy; were it not for this Name of grace, we ſhould never tell how to open our mouthes before the Lord; If he ſhould ſay unto us, what can you ſay for your ſelves why I ſhould not condemne you? We muſt anſwer, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing, Lord, nothing in our ſelves; onely thou art gracious who freely pardoneſt the ſins of thy people; I cannot deſire to be accepted of thee for any thing that is in me, but I commit my ſelfe to thy free and rich grace, which is able to do for me abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly above that I can aske or thinke.</p>
               <p>And here (to adde a word more concerning the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, of which I have ſpoken ſomething before) we may by that which hath been ſpoken, diſcerne the right uſe of thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they are to be incouragements or attractives to draw us to rely upon free grace in ſuch times when we are moſt diſcouraged in our ſelves; there be ſeverall ſeaſons in which both kinds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (both abſolute and conditionall) are of ſpeciall uſe; there is a time wherein the ſoule is apt to ſlumber, being overtaken with a ſpirit of ſecurity, apt to preſume and to walke negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; there is a time alſo of diſmayedneſſe and dejection of Spirit, every thing cauſing feare, though we walke in conſcionable care before God. Now when that ſecurity and careleſneſs prevails in us, then is a time for us to look unto the conditionall promiſes, and the qualifications expreſſed in them, not giving reſt unto our ſelves, untill we finde them in our ſelves; contrariwiſe, when the ſoule lyes under fear, preſſed downe with ſence of our owne vile unworthineſſe, then is a time to looke unto the abſolute promiſes, conſidering with our ſelves though we be poore, loſt, wretched, miſerable, yet the Lord hath promiſed for his own ſake
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:113533:169"/> to ſuccour us, and to do us good. To apply abſolute promiſes to one of a looſe carnall and ſenſuall ſpirit, it is as if you ſhould give him a cup of poiſon to drink; but to apply the ſame to a poor dejected ſpirit, ſenſible of its owne vileneſſe, here it is as new wine which glads the heart of man; Every thing is beautifull in its ſeaſon, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks; ſo are theſe promiſes in their ſeverall ſeaſons; the abſolute promiſes to incourage the weak, and dejected; the conditionall to ſearch, to waken and ſtirre up the ſecure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 3. To exhort us to honour this free grace of God, by which we are taken into Covenant with him; all that God doth towards us, being done for the praiſe of this glorious grace of his, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. This is Gods end, and this was <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14. ever ſeeking to magnifie this grace, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.7. where there is mention of <hi>rich</hi> mercy <hi>great</hi> love, <hi>exceeding</hi> riches of grace, <hi>great</hi> goodnes, <hi>tender</hi> love, <hi>great</hi> mercy, <hi>multitude</hi> of loving kindneſſes; Reſerve we therefore the whole glory of our ſalvation intire unto grace alone, mixe nothing with it, adde nothing to it; adding and mixing debaſeth it, as water mixed with wine, or copper with gold. It was <hi>Davids</hi> expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he uſed, when he had received thoſe ample promiſes from God, for thy words ſake, and according to thine own heart (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) haſt thou done all theſe great things unto thy ſervant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.21. ſo thinke we, all that mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which the Lord hath done for us, he hath not done it for our ſakes, or according to our worthineſſe, but according to his owne heart, according to the purpoſe of his grace towards us; ſay therefore, <hi>Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name be the praiſe;</hi> it is enough for us that we have life, the bleſſing, the comfort; let grace alone have all the glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. To ſtir us up to imitate this free grace of God, which is ſhewed on us; Firſt loving the Lord not for his gifts and rewards, but with a free love as he hath loved us, and ſerving him with a free ſpirit and a willing minde. Secondly, be free in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good unto all men, even to ſuch as have deſerved nothing, (or if any thing, onely evill at our hand) though they be aliens and ſtrangers and ſuch as we never hope to receive any good from, yet freely do them good, even where we look for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:113533:170"/> againe, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.12, 14. as God hath done unto us, ſo doe we unto them; in this we ſhall ſhew our ſelves the children of our Father in heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it is a free Covenant, ſo it is a ſure Covenant, certaine to bee performed; It cannot faile, thoſe that reſt upon it ſhall finde it will not be as a lie unto them to deceive them; but the accompliſhment will every way anſwer their expectation and hope; Thus ſaith <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. God hath made with me a Covenant <hi>perfect</hi> in all points, and <hi>ſure,</hi> and in <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.3. The promiſes of the Covenant are called the <hi>ſure mercies</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> not becauſe they are ſure unto <hi>David</hi> alone, but becauſe they are ſure, and ſhall be ſure unto all the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> that are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God as <hi>David</hi> was; The promiſes of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are not yea, and nay, various and uncertaine; but they are Yea, and Amen, ſure to be fulfilled 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. There ſhall not faile ſo much as one word of all that good which God hath promiſed to doe for his people, ſee <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 21.45. &amp; 23.14. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.56. The ſtability of Gods Covenant is compared to the firmneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movableneſſe of the mighty mountaines, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.19. and to the unvariable courſe of the day and night, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.20. to imply that it is as eaſie (yea, more eaſie, as the places quoted import) for the mountaines to remove out of their places, and the courſe of the day and night to ceaſe, as for the Covenant of God to faile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The Covenant and promiſes of grace are built upon the unchangeable purpoſe of God, which is a foundation remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſure, and cannot be ſhaken, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. and for this cauſe it is, that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. the Lord is ſaid to have promiſed eternall life, before the world began; not that any promiſe could then be made to us in perſon; but becauſe, firſt, God then purpoſed it in himſelfe; ſecondly, According to that his purpoſe, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life to Chriſt for us, and in our behalfe; and thirdly, becauſe the promiſe of life which is in time made unto us, in our own perſon, is according to that purpoſe of God in himſelfe, and that promiſe from everlaſting made unto Chriſt; and hereto agrees that of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. where he grounds the truth and certainty of the promiſe, upon the ſtableneſſe of Gods <hi>counſell;</hi> ſo that unleſſe Gods Counſell and purpoſe change, the promiſe cannot faile.</p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:113533:170"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The freeneſſe of the Covenant proves the ſureneſſe, and certainty of it, as before we argued: It is free that it might bee ſure; ſo here, its ſure becauſe its free; the former Covenant of works was not ſure, becauſe it was not free, but depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome things in our ſelves, which were mutable and changeable; and if the Covenant of grace did depend upon the mutability of our will (as that did) the promiſe of life now made to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant could be no ſurer then it was before; but this Covenant is free and therefore ſure; nothing can hinder free grace from giving eternall life to whom it will; mans unrighteouſneſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming betweene, may prevent a promiſe made upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of righteouſneſſe, but it cannot prevent a promiſe of free grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. God hath given us many pledges to aſſure us of the certainty of his Covenant, and the bleſſing of it. Firſt, his word is gone out of his mouth, and he cannot alter it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he hath written it, to make it more ſure; and what he hath written, is written never to be blotted out. Thirdly, He hath ſealed it with his own ſeale, and ſo it is become as the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which alter not. Fourthly, He hath ſworn it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Men may be ſaid to be in Covenant with God two wayes; Firſt, In appearance, by viſible profeſſion; Secondly, According to truth; the former ſort profeſſe hope in the promiſe of life, but being hypocrites which never gave themſelves to the Lord in truth, they fall ſhort of the promiſe, and are deprived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. But thoſe which are truly in Covenant with God, having given up themſelves unto him in ſimplicity and truth to be his people, towards theſe Gods promiſe ſtands firme, never to be changed. There were in <hi>Iſrael</hi> a mixt people, ſome believed, ſome
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:113533:171"/> believed not, and yet they all did in ſhew accept the conditions of the Covenant, and profeſſed themſelves to be a people in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God: Thoſe of them which in truth believed, had the promiſe of God fully accompliſhed unto them; Thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not, they enjoyed it not, becauſe of their unbeliefe; they were in <hi>truth</hi> none of the children of the Covenant, although they profeſſed it; and therefore no marvell they miſſed of the bleſſing promiſed: As in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32, 33. Some are ſaid to be blotted out of the book of life; not that thoſe which are written in it, are ever indeed blotted out; but becauſe ſome which ſeemed to have their names written therein, are at length declared and made manifeſt that they never were of thoſe that were written there; but were written in earth as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.13. rather then in heaven; ſo it is here in the caſe in hand; God ſeemes to break his promiſe with ſome; but not with thoſe which are truly in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him; only he makes ſuch hypocrites as profeſſe and pretend hope of obtaining the promiſe, to ſee and feele that all their expectation is in vaine, when they finde themſelves diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the bleſſing they hoped for. The one ſort (namely, ſuch as truly believe) they enjoy the promiſe, following faith to the conſervation of the ſoule; the other ſort (namely ſeeming hypocrites, and formall profeſſors) deprive themſelves through unbeliefe; but the Covenant and promiſe of God ſtands firme and ſure, to all that lay hold on it by a true faith.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This may ſhame us for our unbeliefe: When we heare of the great things of the Covenant, which God hath promiſed, we heare them as matters beyond beliefe; Thoſe that publiſh theſe things of our peace and ſalvation, may ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our report? Eſay</hi> 53.1. We look at theſe things as things of which there is no certainty; we heare of them, but we believe them not: This is evident by our little ſeeking after them, our little minding of them, that we doe no more comfort our ſelves in the remembrance of them, and rejoyce in the hope of them: Theſe things are plaine evidences, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we believe them not, or our faith concerning them is very ſmall. Fulneſſe of faith concerning theſe, would bring on ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of joy, to rejoyce under the hope of the glory of God, and would cauſe us to preſſe hard towards the mark, ſo running that we
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:113533:171"/> might obtaine; Let us ſhame our ſelves before the Lord for this our unbeliefe; ſhall he promiſe and not perform? ſhall he ſpeak to us and write to us, and ſweare to us, and ſeale to all with his own ſeale, and we not believe him? Let God be true, though every man be a lyar; conſider how by our unbeliefe we doe both caſt diſhonour upon the Lord, and weaken our own comfort, which we might be filled with through believing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Is the Covenant and promiſes of it ſo ſure? This then may miniſter a ground of ſtrong conſolation unto all ſuch as have given up themſelves unto God to be a people in Covenant with him: Let them know Gods Covenant is ſure, and cannot faile them; you that are ſuch, lift up your heads, comfort your hearts, ſtrengthen the weak hands, and feeble knees; Look upwards and rejoyce in the expectation of thoſe great things which are laid up for you: They are ſo great, that you can hardly believe them, yet they are ſure, as the promiſe, Covenant and Oath of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God can make them. When you ſee uncertainty and unſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all things, riches goe away, friends forſake, ſtrength failes; Let your ſtay and comfort be, that yet Gods Covenant failes not; the riches of the world may be conſumed, but his grace is an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſubſtance; other friends may hide themſelves, and ſtand afarre off in the day of affliction, but the Lord will not forſake his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and though ſtrength decay, and life be ready to depart yet he will be the ſtrength of our heart, and our portion for ever. <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall ſooner paſſe away, then on tittle of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Could we in our meditations dwell more upon the certainty of this Covenant, which is ſo perfect and ſure in all points, it would much help to uphold us in our greateſt failings. Sometimes things are ſo croſſe and contrary to that which God hath promiſed, that his promiſe ſeemes to be but winde, and vanity and lies: his word ſpeaks good to us, but his dealing is quite contrary: There are great words, but little done; we ſee little but ſinne and miſery, and corruption in our ſelves, with chaſtiſement and affliction from God, we enjoy not the bleſſing promiſed: It is with us, as it was with <hi>Gideon,</hi> when the Angel uttered thoſe comfortable words unto him, <hi>The Lord is with thee thou valiant man; Ah</hi> ſaith <hi>Gideon, Is the Lord with us? why then is all this evill come upon us?
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:113533:172"/> where are all his miracles our Fathers told us of? the Lord hath now forſaken us,</hi> Judges 6.13. So it was with <hi>David,</hi> he had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Kingdome made unto him by <hi>Samuel,</hi> who alſo anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him thereunto; but before he came to the poſſeſſion of it, he met with ſo many croſſe haps, and contrary events, that <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think all <hi>Samuels</hi> words to be but lies; he concludes, <hi>All men are lyars,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelfe is no better. Thus it is with us, we meet with many ſad croſſes, and hard events, which ſeeme quite contrary to the promiſe of God; Theſe make us to feare and doubt of the promiſe, and not only to ſay with <hi>David, All men are lyars;</hi> but with <hi>Jeremy</hi> to ſay to God himſelfe, <hi>Be not thou as a lyar unto me, Jer.</hi> 15.18. As if all the promiſes of God were quaſht, and come to nought: But conſider, though your faith may be thus exerciſed for a ſeaſon, yet Gods promiſe is faithfull and ſure. Theſe are times in which God comes to us as he came to <hi>Abraham</hi> to prove him, God made <hi>Abraham</hi> a promiſe, that of his ſeed Chriſt ſhould come, in whom all Nations ſhould be bleſſed; this promiſe God never meant to reverſe; yet he will try <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, he will ſee whether <hi>Abraham</hi> can believe this, and hold unto it, when a ſore ſhock and plunge comes which ſhall ſeeme quite to overturn and daſh all: Here therefore to try <hi>Abraham,</hi> God bids him goe and ſacrifice his Sonne; here rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> this is againſt the promiſe, for if <hi>Iſaac</hi> be ſacrificed, how can the Meſſias come out of his ſeed? but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> believes though he cannot tell how; yet doubtleſſe God will fulfill his promiſe; and ſo he did: Thus God will try the faith of his ſervants; ſeeming to work clean contrary to his promiſe, yet not as intending to break it, but intending to try their faith, to ſee whether they can then believe the promiſe when all things make againſt it: In ſuch times our work is, to ſtirre up our faith, believing the firmneſſe and ſtability of the Covenant of God, aſſuring our ſelves, that heaven ſhall ſooner be confounded with earth, and turn into a Chaos again, the Sun ſhall ſooner be turned into darkneſſe, the fire ſhall ſooner ceaſe to burn, the mighty Rocks and Mountaines ſhall ſooner be thrown out of their places, then the promiſe of God ſhall faile, which is a ſure foundation which cannot bee removed: Whatſoever therefore the <hi>work</hi> of God ſeemes to <hi>pretend,</hi> yet judge of Gods <hi>intent</hi> by his <hi>promiſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:113533:172"/> whatſoever falls out in the way, Gods intent, Gods end is to fulfill his Covenant, thats ſure; eye this end, and hold faſt to the concluſion which God makes in his promiſe, and though you cannot anſwer the argument which reaſon will frame out of thoſe things, which ſence ſuggeſts, yet hold the concluſion, Gods promiſe is ſure, his Covenant failes not, here reſt, and waite for it.</p>

Conſider that all Gods people that have gone before us, which doe now inherite the promiſes, and have them in poſſeſſion, have met with the ſame diſcouragements as we doe: They were tryed in their faith and patience before they came to enjoy the bleſſing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11.12. &amp;c and the ſame things are fulfilled in the reſt of our bretheren, which are now in the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. they have their ſhakings, doubts, and feares, as well as we. Be not therefore diſcouraged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See that the promiſes of God be precious unto you; ſo have the children of God eſteemed them, as of great and precious things, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. they are pearls unto thoſe that are owners of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. the more we prize them, the more may we aſſure our ſelves of our part in them; and that they ſhall be ſurely made good unto us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Keep Chriſt neare unto us, for it is he in whom all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are unto us Yea and Amen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Lay him therefore in our hearts; Let him lie between our breaſts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.12. Let him be to us the dearely beloved of our ſoule; make him our hope, as the Apoſtle calls him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. even our hope of glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. Keep him near to us, and hope through him, and we ſhall not be diſappointed of our hope.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, labour to keep in our ſelves a cleare ſight of thoſe graces that are expreſſed in the conditionall promiſes, they being the companions of the faith which ſaveth us; take heed of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to be wounded and darkned in us, by worldlineſſe, wrath, impatiency, but keep them ſhining, and bright; the more evidently we can diſcern theſe, the more evidence we have of the bleſſing of the Covenant, and the more aſſurance of full poſſeſſion: Theſe graces are (as twere) our anoynting, by which we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted before hand unto the Kingdome; Look to our anoynting then; If God have anoynted us by the oyle of his ſpirit, it is not
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:113533:173"/> for nothing that he hath done it: it is an aſſurance unto us, that it is his pleaſure to give us the Kingdome. <hi>David</hi> being anoynted by <hi>Samuel,</hi> got the Kingdome at laſt, though he went through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles firſt.</p>

This ſhould teach us all to preferre the things of Gods Covenant, being ſo ſure and certaine, before all the uncertaine vanities of this deceitfull world. What the Apoſtle ſpeaks of riches, calling them uncertaine riches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. the ſame may be truly affirmed of all worldly things, honour, favour of men, &amp;c. they are all uncertaine things; The hope of them is uncertaine, and many times proves vaine, as it did to <hi>Balaam,</hi> who had faire hopes before him of riſing to great honour, but all was quaſht in a moment, when he was ſlaine with the ſword, and ſent down to the ſides of the pit among the uncircumciſed.</p>
               <p>And as is the hope, ſo is the poſſeſſion of them uncertaine alſo, as it was to <hi>Haman,</hi> who in the midſt of all his honour, ſtood but in a ſlippery place; for being in honour he continued not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like unto the beaſts that periſh. What is there of any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under the Sunne? The world (and all things in it) is not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared to a wheele, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. and 10. which is of various and uncertaine motion, now up, now down, now going, anon returning; there is nothing ſure in this world, but only what we hold by the ſure and faithfull Covenant of God; and therefore as Chriſt when he ſaw his Diſciples admiring the ſtately building of the Temple: Are theſe (ſaith he) the things yee look upon? ſo ſhould we ſay unto our ſelves: rebuking theſe our fooliſh hearts, when we ſee them taken with this worlds uncertaine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; Are theſe the things yee look for? yee walk in a ſhadow, and diſquiet you ſelves in vaine, ye graſpe at that which ye have no aſſurance to attaine, or if ye doe attaine, yet cannot long poſſeſſe; ſuch are all worldly things; But the things which God hath promiſed in his Covenant, are ſure, certaine, infallible, though the world be a lyar, yet God is faithfull and true, he cannot deny himſelfe; The holy Apoſtle did well diſcern this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the things of God, and the things of this world; one of them he calls uncertaine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. but ſpeaking of the other, I fight not as uncertaine, as one that beats the ayre, but as certaine to obtaine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26. Truly while a man contends for the things
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:113533:173"/> of this world, he doth but beat the ayre, as if a man ſhould ſpend his ſtrength in ſtriking great blows at an airie ſhadow, whiles his enemy in the meane time goes free away: But thoſe which runne for the crown which God hath promiſed, they ſhall in time finde that they have not run in vaine, neither have laboured in vaine, they ſhall finde a ſure reward, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.18. We love not to loſe our labour; we think, better ſit ſtill, then labour for nothing. But this encourageth to ſtrive with our beſt ſtrength, when we have the prize in our eye, when we are ſure to obtaine: Here therefore, firſt by faith believe the truth of Gods promiſe, and then put on in practice, to ſeek after the things which God hath promiſed, looking at the glory and joy which is ſet before us, and then the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi> will be our own mercies alſo, as <hi>Jonah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.8. and will be as ſure to us as to <hi>David</hi> or any of his ſeed: How ſure the Apoſtle eſteemed them, ſee 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8, 18. Take we heed then, leſt by following lying vanities, we forſake our owne mercies; that mercy and bleſſing I meane, which if we diligently ſeek after, ſhall ſurely be our own.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

All the bleſſings of the Covenant are to continue, not only like <hi>Ioſephs</hi> bleſſing, to the end of the everlaſting hills, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.26. but for ever and for ever.

Hence it is that baptiſme is but once adminiſtred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Covenant is but once made, the promiſe of it being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven once and for ever: The ſupper is often adminiſtred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the many breaches on our part, and the manifold weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of our faith which we are ſubject unto, the Lord being pleaſed in that Sacrament to renue the ſeale of his Covenant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, for the ſetling of our faith, and the ſtabliſhing of us in the aſſurance of his grace, which hath been ſo often witneſſed to us, in the renuing of the Seale of the Covenant; but baptiſme being the Seale of our enterance into Covenant with God, is but once adminiſtred, becauſe the Covenant is but once made, and being once made ſtands faſt for ever.

                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From Gods vnchangableneſſe, he is a God that changeth

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If this reaſon hold that the Covenant of grace is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore everlaſting, becauſe God is unchangeable, then by the ſame argument, the Covenant of works may be proved to be everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, ſo that that Covenant ſhould not have been broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It followeth not, becauſe the Covenant of works (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the accompliſhment of it by man, with whom it was made) was not built upon Gods purpoſe within himſelfe, but was left to the liberty and will of man, either to fulfill it, or break it as himſelfe would; but the Covenant of grace is built upon Gods immutable purpoſe, which cannot change: The Apoſtle joynes theſe two together, purpoſe and Grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. to give us to underſtand, that all the wayes of his grace which he leads his people into (and therefore alſo this way of his Covenant) is according to his eternall purpoſe within himſelfe: Herein that firſt Covenant was not as this latter is, and therefore though the one was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet the other cannot; Secondly, This may be added alſo, that that firſt Covenant (in reſpect of the ſubſtance of it) is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and everlaſting; and it is the unchangeableneſſe of it, which doth condemne all the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and did bring Chriſt from heaven to fulfill it for thoſe which ſhould believe; Gods unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able juſtice, will not ſuffer any unjuſt perſon to live; in ſo much that either we muſt have Chriſt to fulfill the juſtice of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for us, or elſe for the breach of it we muſt periſh for ever: None but righteous ones ſaith juſtice, ſhall have life, the reward of righteouſneſſe: This juſtice in God is unalterable, and changeth not, and thus farre there is little or no difference between the one Covenant and the other, but both are alike; but here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that in the Covenant of works, God promiſed life to <hi>Adam</hi> in caſe he obeyed, but did not promiſe to uphold him in a way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to the end that he might not miſſe of the life promiſed; Whereas in the Covenant of grace God doth not only promiſe life to thoſe that doe believe, but promiſeth that their faith ſhall not faile, and that he will keep them by faith unto ſalvation, and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:113533:175"/> preſerve them to his heavenly Kingdome; The promiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this Covenant are larger and better then of that other, this being made with none but with thoſe that the purpoſe of his grace doth reach unto: He makes this Covenant with his choſen, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3. and with them only; It is revealed to many, but made up with few, even with thoſe that are veſſels of mercy prepared unto glory; thirdly, In the Covenant of works diſtinguiſh theſe two: Firſt, the terme, ſubſtance, or heads of the Covenant propounded and agreed upon betwixt God and man; ſecondly, The fulfilling or violation of it by man with whom it was made. The ſubſtance of the Covenant is one, the fulfilling of it is another; The ſubſtance of it <hi>(doe this and live)</hi> is not changed, though the fulfilling of it by <hi>Adam</hi> did faile, as well it might, becauſe God never promiſed him to cauſe him to fulfill it; but only to give him life in caſe he did work therein: But in the Covenant of Grace both theſe are promiſed, one as well as the other, the Lord not only promiſing life to thoſe that doe believe, but that he will uphold us in the faith unto the end: And hereupon it follows, that though in the Covenant of works, man failed in his duty, yet the Covenant on Gods part remaines inviolate; for if God give life upon obedience performed, or inflict death upon diſobedience, God doth in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performe this Covenant towards man, this being all that God promiſed in that Covenant; but in the Covenant of Grace there can be no totall breach on our part, ſo as to diſſolve the Covenant betwixt God and us, but it will import a failing of the Covenant on Gods part alſo, becauſe he hath promiſed us to keep us with him for ever, and gives this as the reaſon why his Covenant with us ſhall be everlaſting; namely, becauſe he will put his feare unto our hearts, ſo that we ſhall never depart away from him; ſo that if the Lord ſhould now ſuffer his Covenant-people wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and to break Covenant with him; there muſt follow ſome change of minde in God, as having thoughts <hi>of love</hi> towards us, when he took us into Covenant with him, and <hi>of diſlike</hi> when he ſuffers us to depart from him; but there is no ſuch change in God, therefore this his Covenant with us is everlaſting.</p>

If this Covenant had been for a little ſeaſon, it had been the leſſe mercy, but that we ſhould have the High God, to enter into an everlaſting Covenant, to be our God for ever; who can ſufficiently admire this goodneſſe?

In reſpect of the Commandement, it commands holineſſe, <hi>Be ye holy, ſaith the Lord, for I the Lord your God am holy,</hi> Levit. 11.44. &amp; 19.2. &amp; 20.7. and therefore it is that Gods calling is termed an holy calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. and we called unto holineſſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.7. and when God takes us into Covenant with him, he chargeth us henceforth to touch no unclean thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.</p>

And in regard of this effect of the Covenant thus working holineſſe in thoſe that are the people of God, they are called the holy people, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. and the people of Gods holineſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.18. So in all theſe reſpects the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may well be called an holy Covenant.</p>
               <p>And it muſt needs be an holy Covenant: Firſt, becauſe the Lord himſelfe is the author and ordainer of this Covenant; the ſumme and ſubſtance of it was framed and ſet down in heaven, in the counſels of eternity, comming forth from the boſome of the Father, and concluded by the aſſent of the Sonne and holy Ghoſt: All the articles of it were firſt decreed and concluded there; and therefore muſt needs be holy: If they had been deviſed by men, they would have been of an other quality, ſavouring of the ſinfull and licentious ſpirit that is in man; but being a Covenant of the Lords own drawing, he ſetting down all the articles and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, it muſt needs be as himſelfe is, an holy Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ſo pure and holy a God: hence it is that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.6. he hath ſpoken (the words of his Covenant) in his holineſſe: Look as grace and holineſſe are united together in God, ſo they are in his Covenant; God can no more ceaſe to be holy, then he can to be gracious: he is both gracious and holy, ſo that his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is alſo an holy Covenant, as proceeding from him which is both gracious and holy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the end of this Covenant, is to make us partakers of all the holy things of God, from which all unholy and uncleane ones are excluded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.2, 3, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. but thoſe that are ſanctified enjoy them, and uſe them as their own; they are <hi>their</hi> portion, <hi>their</hi> inheritance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. <hi>their</hi> pearles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. The
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:113533:177"/> Lord would have all his Ordinances to be uſed holily, he cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to have them prophaned, and therefore it is that in <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.21. none but ſuch as were ſeparate from their uncleaneſſe might eat of the holy things; and therefore the Lord will have his people to be an holy people, that they may participate in all his holy things.</p>
               <p>Nay more, we are called not only to participation of theſe holy things of God, but to fellowſhip with God himſelfe, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3. The Lord ſaith unto them, <hi>ye are my people;</hi> and they ſay unto him, <hi>thou art our God, Zach.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> But without holineſſe no man can have fellowſhip with God, and therefore they muſt be an holy people that are taken into Covenant with God, to enjoy follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion with him.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But wherein ſtands that holineſſe which the Covenant requires of all Gods covenanted people?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a twofold holineſſe, 1. Relative, 2. Poſitive.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be a ſeparation from common uſe; in this ſence things holy, are called ſeparate things, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19 2. Things common in Scripture are oppoſed to holy, to ſhew that holy things muſt be ſeparate from common uſe: Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of Gods taking <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his own, he uſeth that expreſſion, <hi>Thou haſt ſeparated them unto thy ſelfe, from all the people of the earth, &amp;c.</hi> and thence was that exhortation of <hi>Ezra, Separate your ſelves from the people of the lands, Ezrah</hi> 10.11. and that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Come out from among them, and ſeparate your ſelves,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. If then we will be holy, we muſt be ſeparate from the common converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, having no fellowſhip with the works thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be a dedication and devoting our ſelves unto God, we muſt be offered up and given unto him; Thus the holy dayes were dedicated unto the ſervice of God, they were not only ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from common and ordinary uſe, but were dedicated to the Lords ſervice; thus were the firſt fruits called holy, and thence the holy things, and the dedicated things, are taken for one and the ſame, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.15. as the Altar, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. end, the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.63. and thus muſt we be dedicate or given to the Lord, as is ſaid of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that they gave themſelves to the Lord,

               <p n="1">1. Habituall, qualifying and fitting us by graces infuſed for the ſervice of God, which we are devoted unto; as all the things that were appointed for the ſervice of God, were anoynted with the holy oyl, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.26, 27. ſo muſt we be anoynted with the ſweet oyntments which are the graces of the ſpirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. The oyntment of the holy Ghoſt which was poured upon the head of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. muſt run down upon us, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his oyntment may be found upon us, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. we muſt be ſanctified throughout, in ſoule, in body, and in ſpirit, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Actuall, its not enough to have grace in us, but there muſt be an holy uſe and exerciſe of thoſe graces that are in us; they are not given to us to be idle, or that we ſhould be ſlothfull in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them, but that we ſhould put them forth in our practice, ſo as to be fruitfull in the improvement of them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. and thence it is that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the holineſſe which the Lord requires to be in his people; he doth not only require a holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>diſpoſition</hi> by inherent graces, but that we ſhould be holy in all <hi>manner of converſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. and for this cauſe the way of Saints is called holy, <hi>Eſay</hi> 35.8. they are ſanctified, not only in their veſſels, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. but their way is holy alſo, and they are ſaid to be undefiled in their way, <hi>Pſal</hi> 11 9. where the ſoule is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the ſpirit of Chriſt, the life will be holy and ſanctified alſo: Now this holineſſe of converſation muſt be ſhewed: firſt, in duties of Religion, which are acts properly holy; holineſſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, will as naturally put a Chriſtian upon duties of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, prayer, meditation, and other ſpirituall exerciſes, as a ſinfull diſpoſition doth put us upon acts that are ſinfull: Holineſſe will make us minde the things that are holy, and to exerciſe our ſelves in them in a holy manner, with holy reverence, holy ſeare, holy deſires of enjoying the Lord in them, with holy rejoycing in his preſence, and an holy zeale for his glory: And though holineſſe begins here, yet it doth not end here; therefore, ſecondly, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe planted in the heart will cauſe holineſſe to ſhine forth in our actions of common life, ſo that though the things we deale in
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:113533:178"/> be but outward and civill; yet our manner of dealing in them, ſhall be ſpirituall and holy: As thoſe that are unholy, doe by an unholy uſe of them pollute unto themſelves the holy things of God, which they take in hand, they dealing in thoſe holy things in an ordinary and common manner; ſo contrariwiſe, whom God hath ſanctified, they doe ſanctifie to themſelves the common and ordinary actions of this life, by uſing them not in an ordinary prophane manner, but holily; to the one the things that are holy, become as if they were prophane, to the other the prophane and common, as if they were holy; If we eat, holineſſe cauſeth us to eat as before God, and to eat for God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.12. <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. If we exerciſe our ſelves in our calling, holineſſe directs a Chriſtian to referre it to the glory of God. The man of warre hath holineſſe written upon his horſe bridles, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.20. he goes to warre before the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.6. and fights the battels of the Lord, as fighting not for men but for God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.28. when he handles the ſword, he conſecrates his hand unto the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.29. and therein doth the work of the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.10. The Merchant (in time of peace) turns his merchandizing to be holineſſe to the Lord, that there may be ſufficient for them that miniſter before the Lord, to eat ſufficiently, and to have durable cloathing, <hi>Eſay</hi> 23.18. Every one in their ſeverall places and callings, walking holily before the Lord; ſo that whether the things they deale about, be holy, or common; yet thoſe which are holy, muſt and do walk holily in both; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holineſſe of the inward man, manifeſting it ſelfe in all our outward converſation, whether towards God in the things of God, or towards men in the things wherein we have to deale with men.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This lets us ſee the true cauſe whence it is that ſo few among the multitudes of men that are in the world, are willing to embrace this Covenant, which the Lord offers to enter into with men; It might juſtly be wondred at, that (it containing ſuch admirable and high priviledges as it doth) it ſhould not draw all men unto it, that they might enjoy the benefit of it. But here is the reaſon of it; It is a holy Covenant, though it offer much grace, yet it hath this property, it is holy, and requireth holineſſe in all thoſe that claime any part in it, and this makes men to withdraw themſelves from it, becauſe it calls for holineſſe in all that look
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:113533:179"/> to live by it; They are fleſhly, carnall, prophane, unholy, loathing the way of holineſſe, and therefore they forſake the holy Covenant, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.30. They like well to heare of the offers and bleſſings of the Covenant which it brings, and the ſalvation which it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; But when it comes to require holineſſe of them that lay hold on it, telling them that they muſt be holy as God is holy; this makes all to be unto them of a deadly favour, and proves to be unto them a ſtumbling ſtone, at which they fall to their eternall ruine; This is that which makes the breach betwixt God and man; men would willingly have God reconciled unto them, But this holineſſe of the Covenant they cannot ſubmit unto; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane heart of man is not ſubject to this law of holineſſe, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be; That one clauſe of the Covenant <hi>(Touch no unclean thing)</hi> is the barre which cannot be broken through, which keeps the diſtance and maintaines the enmity betwixt him and them.</p>

To teach us hereby to try our ſelves, whether we be in Covenant with God or no, and have any ſhare in the grace and bleſſing of the Covenant; If we partake in the holineſſe of it, then doe we alſo partake of the grace and bleſſing; The way, and end, muſt not be ſeparated; the holineſſe of the Covenant is the way, eternall life is the end; we muſt have our way in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that our end may be eternall life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. Let ſuch then as are pure and undefiled in their way, let them rejoyce in their portion; all the bleſſings of the Covenant are theirs; God is yours, life is yours, heaven is yours; It is your Fathers pleaſure to give you a Kingdome, feare not though you ſuffer affliction here for a ſeaſon; yet having the anoynting, the holy oyle being already poured upon you, you are in the way, and have a pleadge of the everlaſting inheritance: But as for all ſuch as are unholy, unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they may take Gods Covenant in their mouth, and may hope for the life and bleſſing which it promiſeth; but all their naming of it, will ſtand them in no more ſtead, then did their naming of Chriſt, who had their mouthes full of Lord, Lord, but being workers of iniquity, were bidden to depart from him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. It is ſtrange that any ſuch ſhould flatter themſelves with hope, as looking to enjoy the bleſſing of the Covenant, neglecting the way of it, which is holy; that men ſhould promiſe themſelves peace, whiles they walk after the wicked imaginations of their
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:113533:179"/> own heart, ſeeing God never made Covenant with any to bring any unto life, but only in a way of holineſſe; carnall Libertines mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the nature of this Covenant, and doe indeed take hold on the Devils covenant inſtead of Gods, as if Gods Covenant were thus, that he would forgive us our ſins and ſave us, and yet ſuffer us to walk in our own wayes, fulfilling the will of the fleſh and of the minde; as if he that had been unjuſt might be unjuſt ſtill, and he that had been unholy might be unholy ſtill, and yet might hope for that undefiled inheritance of the Saints; This had been a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:113533:180"/> neglecting duties of juſtice and righteouſneſſe towards men: It was not ſo with the holy Apoſtle, who ſpeaking of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation among the Saints, appeales to their conſciences, how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, how juſtly, how unblameably he had his converſation among them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. theſe two which God hath ſo joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we muſt not put aſunder, if we will approve our ſelves to have attained that holineſſe of truth.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Holineſſe is the perfection of our Chriſtian ſtate; this is that which we wiſh for, even your perfection ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. and what perfection is that? even the ſame that he mentions, Chap 7.1. that they might perfect their holineſſe in the feare o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Holineſſe adds perfection to all other gifts, and without this, they are all of no worth; Wiſdome without holineſſe, is but fox-like craftineſſe; courage without holineſſe, is but lyon-like cruelty; humbleneſſe without holineſſe, is but baſeneſſe of ſpirit; juſtneſſe in dealing
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:113533:181"/> without holineſſe, is but heatheniſh harmleſneſſe; but let holineſs be added to each of theſe, and then are they perfect as a colour of a perfect die.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Holineſſe makes us live the life of God, which all other unſanctified ones are ſtrangers from, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. by holineſſe the life of Chriſt is manifeſt to be in us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. ſo that we may ſay that now we live not our ſelves, but Chriſt liveth in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe makes a man live the life of Devils, holineſſe conformes us to the life of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All thoſe that are in Covenant with God, are a people neare unto him, and being neare unto him, he will be ſanctified in them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. but without holineſſe we pollute his name, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. it is not ſanctified in us.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeaſons and times we live in call for holineſſe; theſe are dayes of grace, wherein we enjoy all the holy things of God more aboundantly then in former times, to the end that we might abound in all the holy graces of the ſpirit; The Lord gives us his holy ordinances, that we might be ſanctified by them, being changed into the ſimilitude of the ſame holineſs. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. And this reaſon ſhould move us the more, becauſe the greater the light is in which we live, the more evident are the blots and blemiſhes which are in us; moats in the Sun-beame being more conſpicuous then beames are in the dark; therefore as the dayes we live in be dayes of light, ſo let us walk as children of light, ſhining forth as lights in the midſt of a perverſe and corrupt generation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Conſider a time of ſeparation muſt come, wherein the Lord Jeſus will divide and ſeparate the holy from the unholy, as a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard ſeparates the ſheep from the goats, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wo then unto all thoſe that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from them, to all thoſe that muſt ſtand without, and be amongſt dogges and Devils, having no fellowſhip with Chriſt, nor with his Saints; Its good therefore to be holy; it will be found ſo then; wo unto the prophane and ungodly at that day.</p>
               <p>And for our ſelves here, the people of <hi>New-England,</hi> we ſhould in a ſpeciall manner labour to ſhine forth in holineſſe above other people; we have that plenty and aboundance of ordinances and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:113533:181"/> meanes of grace as few people enjoy the like; we are as a City ſet upon an hill, in the open view of all the earth, the eyes of the world are upon us, becauſe we profeſſe our ſelves to be a people in Covenant with God, and therefore not only the Lord our God, with whom we have made Covenant, but heaven and earth, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men, that are witneſſes of our profeſſion, will cry ſhame upon us, if wee walke contrary to the Covenant which wee have profeſſed and promiſed to walk in; If we open the mouthes of men againſt our profeſſion, by reaſon of the ſcandallouſnes of our lives, we (of all men) ſhall have the greater ſinne.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Let us ſtudy ſo to walk, that this may be our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and dignity among the Nations of the world, among which we live: That they may be conſtrained to ſay of us, only this people is wiſe, an holy and bleſſed people; that all that ſee us, may ſee and know that the name of the Lord is called upon us; and that we are the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.10. <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.9. There is no people but will ſtrive to excell in ſome thing; what can we excell in, if not in holineſſe? If we look to number, we are the feweſt; If to ſtrength, we are the weakeſt; If to wealth and riches, we are the pooreſt of all the people of God through the whole world, we can not excell (nor ſo much as equall) other people in theſe things; and if we come ſhort in grace and holineſſe too, we are the moſt deſpicable people under heaven; our worldly dignitie is gone, if we loſe the glory of grace too, then is the glory wholly departed from our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vile; ſtrive we therefore herein to excell, and ſuffer not this crown to be taken away from us: Be we an holy people, ſo ſhall we be honourable before God, and precious in the eyes of his Saints.</p>
               <p>And thus alſo of the properties of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now the God of peace, that brought againe the Lord Ieſus, the great ſhepheard of the ſheep, through the blood of the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, make us perfect in all good works to doe his will; working in us that which is pleaſing in his ſight, through Ieſus Chriſt, to whom be prayſe for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
